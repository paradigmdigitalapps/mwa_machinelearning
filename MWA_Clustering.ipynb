On the acquisitions of DCR and Aquiire, let me provide a little color there.  think that may be -- from a hypothesis-driven perspective, that may be an indication that companies are becoming a bit more frugal given the economic uncertainty that they might be experiencing.

So we began with the areas where we can offer the greatest value and then also leverage our greatest core competencies around usability, around having a transactional platform at scale internationally, around getting our arms around the primary purchasing mechanisms that our customers use our platform for.

We had a symposium event there that drew a very significant crowd and a great deal of interest. acting on it for the benefit of their organizations. For example, using community insights, one of our customers observed a very low first-time match rate for invoices compared to leaders in the Coupa community. Upon investigating, they realized that they had overly stringent invoice tolerance values in place.  which virtually every company in the world cares about or certainly should care about.

We go into a market, we find early adopters, we make those customers highly successful and referenceable, we work with them to make sure that they're getting significant value, and then we leverage their insights and their network, we leverage their referenceability to grow to customer , , , ,  and beyond. hange process.

How could they get their spend under management, how could they understand the suppliers that they're working with, how could they automate a lot of baseline processes that are still being done and a whole host of older technology solutions or even done on paper, in many cases. FOs don't have visibility to all of their company spend and -plus percent of them are interested in employing information technology to address that problem. And that's a national data point. So what we're seeing is the interest of our buyer to get better and better at doing that, controlling that spend and optimizing that spend. r buys.  to invest in that market, but we're continuing to invest in other areas as well such as the international expansion that Rob mentioned earlier.  upa payment solution that leverages our greatest strengths.

This brings a human and ethical question which I will not try to solve in this particular article, but it's one worth discussing.

So before you talk about how evil it is, tell me first if you use it. But back to the point--like digital transformation, transcendence is never really done.

I've watched as the word \\\"customer\\\" has gained increasing influence--from the time when Tony Hsieh, CEO and founder of Zappos, was the only\\u00a0 person talking about customer service, to now when everyone is talking about customer experience all the time. The phrase \\\"customer experience\\\" gets a lot more play than it did in the business world in the past, when people would simply throw it around synonymously with\\u00a0the phrase \\\"customer service.\\\" We've established these two things are definitely not the same.

You cannot talk about transcendence without talking about Amazon. An older but still relevant book that details their rise is \\u201cThe Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age Of Amazon\\u201d by Brad Stone, who was given exclusive access at Amazon. Amazon has pivoted from modestly selling books, riding the wave of the late \\u2019s dot-com boom to sell music, movies, electronics and toys, while avoiding disaster in the  bust. I never had heard of Amazon until around the time I graduated college, and I became a customer in  when I was living in Brooklyn, NY. Throughout this period Amazon \\u201cmastered the physics of its own complex distribution network\\u201d and expanded into everything. After earning the spot of top retailer, it redefined itself again as an unstoppable technology firm that sold cloud computing infrastructure as Amazon Web Services.

Amazon\\u2019s customer experience mindset, coupled with its focus on constant innovation, and lack of fear of being misunderstood for long periods of time makes them powerful. What might surprise people is Jeff Bezos is himself rooted in reality and the unavoidable vicissitudes of business. Jeff Bezos does believe one day Amazon could go bankrupt and fail. Most people would be shocked to know this guy talks that way. And as I said, I visited Amazon a few weeks ago, and what I found surprised me - normal, hard working, thoughtful and service-oriented people. I met a VP of Logistics who does ride-alongs with delivery drivers at  am, simply so he can get honest feedback of what life is like making deliveries, and how they can make the process better.

In fact, technological innovations have been at the core of the process of non-conventional democratisation in Bangladesh. For example, extensive use of ICT innovations has enabled financial service providers to reach the remotest part of the country with financial service at the doorsteps of the clients (e.g. MFS and Agent Banking). Similarly, the local administration is fully equipped with digital technology and providing public services at a faster speed which is more transparent and accountable. Our young officials working at the grassroots are spearheading this digital public administration. In other words, the digital culture is on in full force in Bangladesh. n recent time by both the government and the central bank to monitor and evaluate their socio-economic impacts and help policy makers and regulators to make mid-term corrections, if needed. lobal trend of sustainable development related thoughts and practices. The whole world is keenly observing what is going on in Bangladesh, particularly in terms of its inclusive development innovations. It is indeed a challenging job for the social researchers to capture these fast moving changes to help policy makers adopt well informed development policies and monitoring the same for mid-term corrections, if needed. In this context, social researchers in Bangladesh are facing new challenges and at the same time getting equipped with new tools and techniques of research. These processes are to be documented and analysed not only for coming up with new directions for the country itself but also for the rest of the world so that others can follow our footsteps. ies vary between generations. Social researchers ought to focus on effects of varying access and adaptability to technologies. Digitisation of daily life is often linked to disintegration of social life as well. Another area that requires further attention of the social researchers in Bangladesh is to assess the social impact of this technological transformation.   e the long-term strategy to deal with this problem etc. This kind of research will help us in \\u2018protecting the gains\\u2019 we have been making in our socio-economic development, particularly by being digital. The digital technology is also not immune from misuse by the extremist groups. We have seen how some of our misguided youths were instrumental in creating an anarchic situation during Holy Artisan crisis period using digital technology. The society at large, however, rose to the occasion and fought it back unitedly. Yet, the social tensions surrounding undesired radicalisation are not fully contained and social researchers are well advised to keep their eyes open to monitor such social aberrations.  policies is either brushed aside or completely ignored. The corporate social responsibility for the greater good of the people and planet is still not the centre-piece of the on-going policy discourses. Yet, a global consensus is gradually emerging to deal with effects of climate change, to consume sustainably and to preserve the resources for future generations. This ethical push has come out of the global consensus on achieving SDGs and, in particular, the Paris Climate Agreement. Hence, there is a new moral compass for thinkers and doers all over the globe. Though a bit slowly, the focus from short-term growth potential and impacts is still moving towards long-term sustainability concerns. This paradigm shift and social life as a whole (all over the world) is being potently fuelled by dramatic changes in technology. We are indeed thick into digital culture which draws its strength from widespread adoption of digital technology.  researchers including students joined this conference from all around the country. While inaugurating this conference I shared my mind on the changing landscape of social research in a globalised and digitised era. Undoubtedly, we are now experiencing a strange but ever-changing global scenario. On the one hand, there is impetus to work together to attain the SDGs and to \\u2018leave no one behind\\u2019 while attaining those goals. On the other hand, in addition to the sharp increase in social inequality, there is a rising threat from protectionist measures and the trade war between the two giant economies (the US and China) which may constrain global public welfare. In the post global financial era, the BRICS countries have not taken up growth stewardship and more importantly, many experts are apprehending that another global financial crisis may be knocking at our door. The Bank of England has recently predicted that as high as eight per cent of British national income may fall due to BREXIT. The latest Presidential election in Brazil has created a space for rightwing upsurge and may erode most of the social gains made so far. riencing consistently six plus growth rate, the country is now being globally acclaimed as a role model for sustainable and inclusive development. It is now striving to realise bigger dreams such as attaining double digit GDP growth rate, complete eradication of poverty and hunger, and even becoming a high income country by . The recent financial inclusion drive spearheaded by the central bank of the country (with potent support from the government) has virtually brought everyone under the broad umbrella of formal finance. Thanks to the mind-boggling growth of mobile financial services and agent banking millions of the financially disfranchised who never thought of going nearer to a bank branch are now doing regular financial transactions using their mobile sets.

During my tenure as the Governor of Bangladesh Bank, we followed this strategy and our efforts in the end resulted in some quite rewarding outcomes. In particular, we tried to learn by doing and corrected our policies after getting feedback from the grounds. Our researchers at Bangladesh Bank also changed gears and helped capture what was going on ground in the areas of financial inclusion, particularly in understanding the impacts of innovative programmes like mobile financial services, refinanced loans to the share-croppers and as well as to the women entrepreneurs.\",\"h a lot of these corporate nuances and some of the critical conversations that you\\u2019re faced with in today\\u2019s workplace.

Some facilities, particularly small ones, may find it difficult to monitor due to a lack of resources, but it nevertheless raises concerns that authorities and residents may be unaware that water contamination from mountaintop removal has negatively impacted both the source water for public systems and the water these systems then supply to users.  In another example of exploiting scientific uncertainty, a senior member of the National Coal Association argued that more research was necessary to determine safe dust exposure levels.[] While miners and their allies were ultimately successful in getting the law passed, it demanded constant vigilance to ensure enforcement and protest efforts to weaken it.[] The law\\u2019s black lung compensation requirement was particularly poorly implemented, leading to miner strikes and the Black Lung Benefits Act in .[] an Water Act and, since , it has been responsible for issuing permits for mountaintop removal valley fills.

Over a dozen studies published in peer-reviewed journals show significantly higher levels of mortality, cardiovascular disease, birth defects, and cancer in counties with mountaintop removal, compared to those with only underground mining or no mining at all, even when controlling for factors such as poverty and smoking.  a study examining children aged  to  who were exposed to drinking water with  parts per billion (ppb) of manganese exhibited adverse neurological effects compared to a control group of children matched for age, sex, grade, family income and parental education.[] The EPA does not have mandatory limits on manganese in drinking water, but the US Centers for Disease Control lists exposure to manganese in dust or fumes as an occupational hazard that can damage the lung, liver, and kidneys.[] The EPA also doesn\\u2019t set mandatory limits on iron, but an epidemiological study in Norway found that the relative risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn\\u2019s disease, \\u201cincreased by  percent when iron content in the drinking water increased by . mg/L.\\u201d[] y, simply asked mining operators how they believed they would be impacted.[] With every incentive to exaggerate the impacts, nearly half said they would shut down, halting  percent of underground production and  percent of surface production.[] Those assertions diverged wildly from the federally-funded regulatory impact analysis, which based its estimates on  representative \\u201cmodel\\u201d mines and found that the Stream Protection Rule would initially cost up to  coal production jobs, many of which would be offset by new jobs to ensure compliance with the rule.[] That analysis also anticipated it would cost the industry $ million to implement and decrease surface mining nationwide by one million tons annually.[]  and Reclamation Enforcement, housed within the Department of Interior, is responsible for implementing the law.

Both were promptly canceled under the Trump administration.   as well as other favorable studies it had funded. These studies have generally served to erode the appearance of scientific consensus. The narrative that no such consensus exists is then used by industry leaders as a powerful argument against regulation.

The Trump administration subsequently canceled a half-completed federally-funded study the National Academy of Sciences was conducting on the potential health effects of surface mining in central Appalachia, even though dozens of scientific studies indicate that it poses serious threats to the health of nearby residents and destroys their environment. In doing so, the administration not only assured the continuation of a hazardous form of mining but also robbed the public of an important tool to assess its true cost.   patial Health, vol. :, , pp. -.   for latent diseases to manifest themselves.

The industry had been fighting legal challenges to mountaintop removal since a group of West Virginians sued the federal and state government in , claiming that the practice violated a surface mining rule that, according to its author, was specifically designed to counter the environmental impacts of mountaintop removal and that the government issued the industry permits through a process that violated rules under the Clean Water Act. ntatives and government officials who agree with them have even claimed that President Obama\\u2019s real goal was to put the industry out of business.[] The Trump administration is currently in the process of weakening or doing away with virtually all these Obama-era rules.

As a result, greater value will be placed on SEL providers who bring longevity, proven results, practical tools, and adult-first approaches to the table. Recent years have brought about a surge of new SEL players, and many educators have scrambled to put new programs in place. Progressive leaders will emerge by acknowledging that successful SEL requires a perceptual shift from school leadership and staff, and also by discouraging midstream changes in favor of long-term personal growth. Educators will prioritize SEL over technology controls as cyberbullying deterrents. This more comprehensive understanding of social-emotional health will spur schools to prioritize SEL as a foundational response and technology monitoring as a complimentary (but secondary) facet of student wellness and safety. As a result, both physical bullying and cyberbullying will decrease in schools that prioritize meaningful connections, inclusion and emotional regulation.\",\"le in Hasselblad.

In India with the  elections coming up, Facebook has a number of job openings both in India and in the U.S. that are advertising positions to reach out to Indian politicians.

It's really hard in these cases though to know what exactly is going on. You know, if Facebook provides a staffer to a campaign, is that the same as providing a staffer to a corporation?

According to NASSCOM report, about  percent of India\\u2019s total workforce has to be reskilled over the next five years to cope with emerging trends like AI, IoT, machine learning and blockchain. With the start of , let\\u2019s have a look at the  sectors that need to upskill and reskill in the forthcoming year - e fourth industrial revolution, it is also experiencing major disruptions. Top banks across the world are shelling out billions of dollars to upgrade their systems, enhance security and improve digital banking or mobile banking experiences for today\\u2019s tech-savvy consumers. In fact, traditional banks are joining hands with fintech firms to cater to their customers the best way possible. With the fintech revolution taking the banking sector by storm and the changing nature of the workforce, upskilling is the need of the hour. According to Josh Bottomley, Global Head of Digital, Retail Banking and Wealth Management, HSBC, many roles and job titles of tomorrow are unknown to us today. He implies that banks in the near future will hunt for people with adaptability and an evolved skill set indispensable to these jobs.  are trained in a wide array of new-age skills. For instance, the demand for SEO professionals is on the rise since it\\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to make a mark in the extremely crowded digital marketplace. Then come the data analytics experts, who utilise information in unparalleled ways to help ecommerce players better cater to the needs of their customers. In fact, data analytics will continue to remain one of the most sought-out skills in the sector. Looking at the huge impact made by AI in this sector, it\\u2019s only natural that companies require more people who are familiar with it and its applications. acturing plants for years now. It all began in the s when the US started using robots in automotive factories. While those robots were only capable of simple, repetitive tasks, industrial robots have advanced at the speed of light over the last few years. This explains why the manufacturing industry has to upskill and reskill its workforce more than ever. In today\\u2019s age of automation, traditional blue-collar workers will need special skills to meet the requirements of future jobs. There is already a clear demand for professionals who are well-acquainted with new technologies like the computer-based design and D printing. n several factors including new technology, automation and upskilling of the workforce. To keep up with the changing times, then, the training ecosystem needs to shift from quantity to quality-driven training. Instead of having a broad overview, employees will require specialised training in supply chain management and operation skills.   hiring sectors in the country. Unfortunately, the existing workforce of this sector lacks in inventory management, customer service and soft skills. And, this can cause a possible decline in the wholesale industry in the near future. To avoid this, employees in the sector need to go through training that can help them build up the above-mentioned skills. ers. Not only have these advancements changed the experience for patients, but they have also made a significant impact on the lives of health professionals as well. The introduction of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), for example, has been a game changer in this industry by enabling easier sharing of patient information, enhancing patient care, improving public health and lowering treatment costs. Simultaneously, technologies like big data and cloud computing are also revolutionising the healthcare sector. Another major trend is the emergence of online health consultant platforms. Needless to say, the workforce requires upskilling and reskilling to match their abilities with these technological changes. According to the Telecom Sector Skill Council (TSSC), as many as . million employment opportunities will be created in telecom as well as telecom manufacturing over the next  years. While the numbers give a ray of hope, this industry is in dire need of quality professionals capable enough to work with new technologies and enhance their performance with greater efficiency. It\\u2019s no secret that many jobs in the telecom sector are already automated, which further stresses the fact that upskilling is indeed the need of the hour.   are now spending a huge amount of money on education technology. With the rise of digital learning tools and education apps, pedagogy is also constantly evolving. Standing at this point, the importance of upskilling the teachers can\\u2019t be stressed enough. Since they play a vital role in shaping our future generation, regular skill-enhancing programmes need to be organised for teaching professionals. he changing demands of customers. The major focus should be on the reskilling and upskilling of the workforce as new technologies such as AI, data analytics and machine learning will continue to rule the sector in the coming year. An Intel report reveals there will be a significant rise in AI spending by Indian IT companies over the next few months. Considering that the IT industry is directly impacted by technological advancements, it requires people who can\\u2019t be replaced by machines. Further upskilling is necessary to bridge the wide gap between the demand and supply of skilled talent in the IT/ITeS sector. tailers have already started taking measures to prepare for the changing times where technology and data sit at the heart of every operation. Along with the technological advancements, shifting customer expectations have made the need for upskilling and reskilling more important. Many companies are addressing this issue by training their employees with basic IT skills, which will prove to be indispensable for tomorrow\\u2019s jobs. At a time when online shopping is slowly becoming the new norm, it\\u2019s necessary for the retail industry to focus on upskilling its workforce.\",\"hey get a job and meet certain income thresholds\\u2014but currently, private companies provide ISA options in the U.S. Vemo Education works with universities and skills-providers to establish these agreements.

This requires students to pay back  percent of their income for the first five years of employment, and if they don\\u2019t find a job, they aren\\u2019t responsible for payments.

One of the more successful models has been Pluralsight, which is an online platform for IT and software developer training.

A unique model to address this mismatch is Revature\\u2019s platform, which utilizes university partnerships and close collaboration with employers to deliver a program where students pay their tuition over a two-year period after they are employed. ing the need for change at universities.

An important element in understanding the return on investment of higher education is the cost of the degree. ased cost of higher education, online programs are offering not just increased flexibility, but also a major reduction in cost. Coursera offers a fully online master\\u2019s degree from the University of Pennsylvania in computer and information technology for one-third the cost of the on-campus version. Several programs are also allowing students to \\u201ctest\\u201d degrees by taking courses that can eventually be \\u201cstacked\\u201d into a degree, thus lowering their risk. MIT now offers a supply chain management degree with a portion of the curriculum online through edX before students enter the on-campus program. Arizona State University allows students to take the first year online as part of the Global Freshman Academy. In both programs, students complete a portion of the degree online and then apply for the on-campus, full degree at a fraction of the price. odel, the university provides the content, while the OPM primarily puts it online and leads the marketing efforts. The leader in this market is U, which, for example, partners with the University of North Carolina to deliver an online master\\u2019s degree in public health. Another smaller but fast-growing player in this market, which according to Eduventures, is expected to reach $. billion by , is Coursera, which works with the University of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and HEC Paris, among others. Companies like Trilogy Education partner with top universities to deliver in-person skills training on-campus in fields such as coding and cybersecurity. Other companies like Orbis Education partner with universities to help bridge the healthcare provider shortage through a hybrid approach to pre-licensure healthcare programs, while ExecOnline partners with top business schools to deliver executive leadership courses online. middle-income countries like Brazil and Chile. In the U.S., tuition prices have skyrocketed and the cost of an undergraduate degree is  times higher than it was  years ago. Tuition and fees have increased over , percent since the late s and the increase in the cost of food and housing was less than a third of that.  ber of internationally mobile students is expected to increase from . million in  to nearly seven million in . International students are increasingly attractive to universities, as they allow expanded reach and programs offered at different price points. Students from China, India, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea account for more than  percent of students who go abroad to earn their degree, with China as the largest source. The U.S. has seen a recent decline in its growth of international students, which some link to stricter immigration policies, but student flows are expected to increase globally. Pathway programs, which are a small but fast-growing segment of the transnational education market, help foreign students get admission into U.S. institutions through bridging academic entry standards. Companies such as the U.K.-based Study Group and U.S.-based Shorelight partner with universities to set up these programs and use revenue share models, providing an additional revenue source for universities. Most of these programs are in countries that have been traditional draws for higher education like the U.S., but some are now also in countries like China that traditionally send many students overseas. t students. In the U.S., for example, states cut funding deeply after the recession hit\\u2014spending  percent less per student in  than in .

It was a perversion of what Chinese scientists are trying to achieve as they seek to establish themselves and their country in the world of elite science. But it was also an illustration of it. the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC), one of the country\\u2019s main funding bodies, has been running a campaign against such misconduct. Wei Yang, until recently the NNSFC\\u2019s boss, describes a situation in which, to stop interference from outside, the composition of interview panels is kept secret until the last minute.

Making use of it has cost billions more. Nor would China be able to supply all the physicists needed to make use of such a facility. Like the LHC, the next accelerator will be a single lab for the world, wherever it is: these toys are one-per-planet affairs. But the Chinese seem more serious than anyone else about hosting and building the thing. Just as it meant something beyond the world of particle physics when America cancelled its proposed giant SSC and CERN\\u2019s LHC became the biggest game in town, so it would mean something if China took CERN\\u2019s crown. biology led by independent academic researchers has drifted too far from potential medical application.

Vanadium-flow batteries are of interest because, unlike most batteries, in which a single electrolyte is built into the cell, a flow battery has two electrolytes and an open cell through which they pass. This means its storage capacity is governed solely by the size of the tanks that store the electrolytes. That makes it possible, in theory, to build batteries big enough to store energy on a scale useful to large grids. The theory has been developed by Zhang Huamin, a researcher at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, a local arm of CAS.

Science is a big part of this. It is seen in China, as elsewhere, as an ennobling pursuit and a necessary foundation for technological advance. China\\u2019s leaders see such advances as crucial not just to their economy, but also to expanded military prowess and social progress. They want the sort of science that will help China project its power and respond to its people\\u2019s particular problems. They want new clean-energy sources and freedom from resource constraints.

In some labs and institutions in China things doubtless do work that way.

These include applications of the more abstruse aspects of quantum mechanics to computation and cryptography, an area where China is a world leader: it was the first country to send a quantum-encrypted message via a satellite.

That\\u2019s a whole new mission\\u2014one that educators and employers alike are still struggling to understand and embrace. It\\u2019s the role of the federal government, working group members said, to provide the data and analytics that participants need to understand those problems, to facilitate a national policy discussion, to improve financial incentives to make it easier for educators and employers to provide the opportunities workers need, and provide the resources workers need to seize them.  n jobs created since the Great Recession,  million required a bachelor\\u2019s degree or higher. And that imbalance is likely to continue: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,  percent of all jobs created from  to  will require post-secondary education; about  percent will require a B.A. at minimum. Fewer than  percent will require only a high school diploma or less. B.A. first if they want to learn to write computer code or enter another profession that requires a defined set of skills. Students need to make decisions about what kind of degree or major to pursue with little information about what jobs will be open two, four or more years into the future. The high costs contribute to the difficulty of many students completing their education, which leaves a significant portion of them in the worst of both worlds: saddled with debt, but with no degree to show for it.  four-year degree programs over other options. Working group participants said that while the government must be careful to make sure the education it supports leads to good outcomes for students\\u2014primarily jobs\\u2014it should loosen the rules so that students can get financial aid to pay for job-related training that may not include a B.A. \\u201cThe federal government is the only source of liquidity in the system, and they tightly restrict what you can do with that money,\\u201d said one participant, \\u201cparticularly for learners outside those prime educational years.\\u201d ant disadvantage to make individual choices about where high-value propositions are for training and reskilling.\\u201d  or a new career. More thinking needs to go into so-called stackable and modular courses and credentials that can combine skills and knowledge learned in a variety of institutions. The new systems should incorporate innovations like online learning, which would expand access to higher education economically and geographically. Finally, without eroding their commitment to traditional four-year bachelor\\u2019s degrees, colleges and universities, particularly public institutions, need to move students\\u2019 job-training goals closer to the center of their mission.   ational options, so they can assess what courses and credentials will pay off in the long run.  nd upgrade their skills. Employers may worry, reasonably, that their investment in training could backfire if employees quit and take their new skills to a competitor. To move forward from this impasse, some working group members suggested developing a new federally sponsored system in which employers, workers and the federal government would pay into some kind of training account that workers could tap into throughout their careers. Because contributions would be broad-based, individual employers wouldn\\u2019t suffer from asymmetrical losses if employees moved on. For workers, owning the account means they\\u2019d have the freedom to reskill to get a new job or even switch professions as the economy shifts.  finance more specialized training that might be more job-focused or to help older workers upgrade their skills or make a career transition later in life. Congress and the federal government should consider allowing federal loans to be used to pay for shorter-term training as well as traditional degrees, simplify the loan application process, and develop assessment tools to help potential students better evaluate job prospects for various programs and providers.  ligence are becoming a part of more workplaces, shifting the roles for human workers, and increasing the need for not just high-skilled workers, but constant skill upgrades. n faster than wages. More than  percent of students who start college fail to graduate, often ending up with debt but no degree to help them pay it off. Those who do graduate don\\u2019t necessarily have an easy pathway into the white-collar middle class. Meanwhile, the millions of older Americans who need to improve their skills midcareer face an education system whose incentives and federal policies are still built around the idea that \\u201chigher education\\u201d means high school graduates seeking bachelor\\u2019s degrees.    on about credentials and degrees coming from institutions, workers should have some kind of \\u201clifetime transcript\\u201d following them from one job to another that contains information about education and training from a variety of institutions. Those institutions could include community colleges, specialty training institutes and employers.   tution may not be recognized at another institution, forcing the student to repeat or simply lose that credit. Instead, if a student could accumulate credits and credentials over the course of their lives, they could add up to degrees or credentials that enhance their r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9s. \\u201cStacking\\u201d credentials in this way would help students who drop out of degree programs get credit for what they have already learned and make it easier for midcareer workers to pick up where they left off. It also would make it possible for a worker to attend a variety of institutions, from traditional universities to specialty institutes to online schools, and even integrate those credentials with training from an employer. \\u201cWe need to break up that traditional linear pathway of [the] four-year degree,\\u201d said one participant, in favor of \\u201cstackable, modular education.\\u201d inkage between education and jobs. Group members disagreed about how promising some of these ideas are, but generally agreed that they deserve more study and attention from federal policymakers.  ericans will find themselves moving back and forth between school and work \\u2026 or working while studying, or studying while working. The higher education system currently focuses on young adults leaving high school; going forward, working group members said the system needs to expand its concept of who is a student and what is a university. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be very important to make sure that we come up with a system that works in terms of reskilling people, not just at the large firms that have workforce planning, but throughout the economy,\\u201d said one participant.  e approach to financial support could open doors for people at more points in their lives, and also incentivize new types of institutions, such as online education providers, built around training and \\u201cupskilling.\\u201d And a potential new and expanded area for the government lies in its role as a trusted repository of information. In the future, Washington could build and promote a new system for credential-sharing and data-gathering that could replace today\\u2019s strict reliance on degrees with a new menu of qualifications adaptable and portable enough to change with a fast-moving economy of the future. And over the long term, Washington could consider supporting a new system for financing career-related education that workers could tap into as needed throughout their lives.  that\\u2019s not even considering the growing demand for professional credentials. Already, one-quarter of American workers need some kind of license or certificate to do their jobs, and the bureau predicts that percentage will continue to climb.  e Washington could play in that change.

Older workers who want or need to upgrade their education or switch professions have little information about what jobs are in demand and what training is necessary to qualify for them. They may also not be comfortable in a traditional classroom and may lack the financial means to pay out of pocket.

If you've never seen the hilarious 's flick from the tail end of the blaxploitation era, it might be hard to imagine such a setting serving as creative inspiration. Apart from the obvious workplace resonance, Car Wash, like Whack World, is a comedy with a tragic undercurrent. Set in a struggling-class L.A. with Hollywood's haze a distant backdrop, it's a movie about everyday people hustling their way through the workday, playing crazy to preserve their sanity, harboring high aspirations out of pure desperation.

Thus, the assertion is that by allowing large employer treatment for otherwise small employers, but not requiring these entities to meet the coverage requirements, there is created a new plan outside of the ACA limitations and requirements. e resolved ultimately on cross-motions for summary judgment, it is likely the case will not be resolved at the District Court level for - months. with a grant of authority to implement ERISA, as the effort here is to make a change to the definition of AHPs, to which Congress itself has repeatedly objected.

The experiences of one of the co-authors, Sushma Giri, a board member of WLiT and\\u00a0 the only female developer at KLL, can attest to this. Reflecting on her difficulties in locating a public toilet during an emergency situation, she advocated for the importance of public databases to help people locate public toilets and highlighted this issue as a gender-based sanitation problem.

The participation of women in such trainings has seen an increase and participants such as Apsara Karki, Executive Director of SOCH Nepal, mentioned that after the training by KLL, she felt empowered. However, there is still a long way to go before women feel self-reliant in solving technological challenges. One way to remedy this is to start early by encouraging girls in schools to not look at the field of Information technology as an insurmountable problem. This is more important now as research suggests that gender stereotypes about children\\u2019s\\u2019 own intellect emerge at an early age--which is a precondition for the decisions they make about their career.

It is inevitable they will find it favorable to hire men to do a job that can also be done by women.

Lawmakers wanted that opportunity this week. Instead, the embattled leader has again sought to delay proceedings as she battles to guarantee a supportive majority in the House of Commons.Officials in Brussels, and businesses on both sides of the English Channel, have been quick to express their dismay at her decision, as a \\\"no deal\\\" deadline looms ever closer. And after a visit last week with a logistics firm that has recently opened a new fulfilment center in Southampton, thanks in part to the Brexit-related uncertainty about Britain's future trading relationship, it is possible to understand the context for that apparent frustration. It seems particularly acute in the freight and transportation sector.PFS U.K. is a subsidiary of a large U.S. e-commerce company that employs more than , people worldwide and provides shipping and operations support to a slew of brands. It first expanded to Europe almost  years ago, and its operations on this side of the Atlantic have for some time been headquartered in the Belgian city of Liege, just an hour or so from the political heart of the European Union.But late last year, after several clients requested that PFS offer them a separate, U.K.-specific fulfilment location, the company took control of a vast new warehouse space on the English south coast. General Manager Lisa Cooley moved from Tennessee to take charge, and explained quite candidly how much work had been required in such a tight span of time. \\\"It's a little chaotic in the beginning,\\\" she acknowledged, before underlining that thanks to next-day delivery expectations, time is rarely on the side of her consumer retail clients.The costs associated with separate shipping capacities, extra warehousing space, and an expanded workforce to combat the potential challenge of cross-border trading tariffs will all eat into the margins of companies like PFS, forcing them to pass the higher expenditure on to their clients, and then in turn to the end consumer.\\\"Those costs have already been incurred as a contingency measure,\\\" explains Alex Veitch from the Freight Transport Association, who previously worked inside a no-deal Brexit planning team at the U.K.'s tax authority when it consisted of fewer than a dozen people. But he says it is only the larger businesses that can afford to devote time and money to this kind of no-deal planning.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) says its members have continued to hold off on this kind of spending, and says many would need between six weeks and two months to get ready for a no-deal Brexit. According to Craig Beaumont, an external affairs director at the FSB, many such firms have now, \\\"simply run out of time to prepare.\\\"Political allies and opponents o\",\"t consider UBI in complete connection with Single-Payer ideas that are just more toppings of the same bad and failed approach.

It's something that we're building off of a very strong foundation, fortunately, but we want to invest in this even further and get even more rigorous with our training enablement and sales processes.  rates in those use cases that are more kinda cloud content management in nature. So particularly as there are a greater set of products associated with those deals as much as -- you'd always mention they tend to be more complex and, in many cases, longer deal cycles. a couple of numbers there. I think overall when we look at the broader base of large deals, especially the $, plus segment, which are -- while they don't represent the full impact of our CCM platform being sold to customers, they are often representative of the kinds of customers that are using Box in more strategic ways. And we have seen that base of customers grow at about a % basis year-over-year. onna be our ability to bring the best workflow automation capabilities to our customers for content management. That will then allow us to say with workflow, data governance, platform, and eventually our advanced security with Shield, you can then buy that as a suite of capabilities from Box to really help with the digital transformation. So that's already been tested more or less in market through customer conversations, but we want to make that a packaged offering that we can bring to our entire customer base.  to now much more of a strategic platform where customers are automating their business processes where in many cases they're dealing with much more regulated information where compliance and security even more important, where content might even go out and reach through their manufacturing processes or supply chains or customer base. And the fact that they're able to shut down legacy systems.  will be launched in the middle of this year and will be sold as a stand-alone skew in addition to being a part of the new product suites we'll be offering later this year. In FY, we will also focus on enabling intelligent content management by advancing our metadata, skills, and platform capabilities. Combined, these capabilities enable customers to retire legacy ECM technology and integrate Box into ERP systems, line of business apps, business processes, and more. For instance, one customer we closed in Q, Lineage Logistics, international warehousing, and logistics company, will leverage Box Skills through Box platform to power new warehouse automation initiatives. s. What does that equal for the full-year billings gross ex that developer fee? adership in some of our kinda sub-regional segments that are running kinda key countries within EMEA. So overall, we have made some investments in very strong sales leadership and talent to help with EMEA broadly. Solution selling and really just move from enabling customers to use Box for file sharing and collaboration to really using the full suite of Box's capabilities. our years, we've been adding additional value-added products like data governance, our platform capabilities, advanced security capabilities, add-on solutions around the core. What we're finding is as we're moving more toward solutions selling larger transactions, we want to get out of the mode of selling each individual product on a one-off basis to customers and really being able to bring the full suite of Box's cloud content management platform to our customers. da start of the whole context of the overall strategy from an IT standpoint looked very different given the prior relationship structure. We had a number of use cases, some higher value than others. Unfortunately, in some of the high-value ones with this new leadership in place there ended up being a cost versus value gap that we couldn't bridge with the new leadership. ting gross margin throughout FY to range from -%. Once we complete this migration and as we continue to drive these efficiencies, we expect gross margin to trend back up toward the mid-s. Q was another successful quarter of driving operational efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were . million representing % of revenue, a significant improvement from % in the prior year, which includes a roughly % benefit related to the adoption of ASC . Looking ahead, we expect to drive more leverage in sales and marketing as we gain greater efficiencies from our solution selling strategy. tinuing to make sure we can go and drive solutions sales into our customers and much bigger transactions into our accounts.  well. Other parts of performance in FY as well as expectations for FY. To solve this, we will be launched Box Shield as an add-on product later this year. Box Shield will bring intelligent threat detection and content classification natively into Box. We're already hearing from prospective customers that Shield will be transformational to their security and risk posture in protecting critical intellectual property. FY is setting up to be the most exciting year for product innovation in Box's history. And due to the increasing success of our add-on products, we'll be making it much easier for our customers to adopt the full power of our cloud content management platform by launching new product suites in the first half of FY.  in just the go-to-market. And I believe you ended the year at about  quotas carrying. If I kinda correlate that back, then to the billings guidance sort of implied also being kinda in the low-teens there. What are just -- if you kinda walk through the math there, kinda how you're thinking about sales productivity because obviously this skew you made a lot of changes. How are you thinking about sales productivity this coming year versus this last year and kinda the puts and takes versus just call it the headcount side? And then one quick follow-up to that. y driven by the strategic nature of these transactions and we're working to make sure that they can happen as smoothly as possible. And that we're constantly improving our own internal processes to drive these as well as the sales rigor and the operational rigor to make sure that we can get these across the finish line. I think the k deal segment and the k deal segments did show very healthy growth on a year-over-year basis. And as a note, the miss in the seven-figure deal translates through both the k and the k deal segments because it's a cumulative number.  years, you've grown quota carrying headcount well in excess of revenue growth and certainly in excess of billings growth. You would think if the solution sale selling is working, it would certainly be evident in your fiscal fourth quarter where these solution-based large deals really accumulate and seasonally are strong. s a little bit higher than in most quarters by the really strong growth that we saw in Japan that we mentioned as virtually all of those deals are through the channel. s that we'd expected to close in the fourth quarter originally. As we sort of enter the quarter versus what ultimately happened, and then making adjustments for the deals that are near-term that we have visibility into the earlier part of the year. nd. So those are two separate categories that are mutually exclusive, each about $ million. -GAAP profitability and our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow as we continue to drive strong leverage in our business model. We delivered revenue of $. million in Q up % year-over-year with % of Q's revenue coming from regions outside the United States driven by strong performance in Japan throughout the year. We closed  deals over $, versus  a year ago,  deals over $,, which was flat with a year ago, and two deals over $ million versus nine a year ago. Fourth quarter billings came in at $. million representing % calculated and % adjusted billings growth year-over-year following short of our original expectation of growth in the mid-s. ar too difficult to share content and manage business processes across the extended enterprise in addition to being too costly and complex for the digital age. The enterprise content management and storage infrastructure markets represent $ billion in opportunity and Box is the only cloud-native platform built to power the next generation of workloads as they rapidly move from on-prem to the cloud. Entering FY, we have the most exciting product roadmap in our company's history focused entirely on enabling our customers to power their digital business processes and to retire legacy content management systems. ch as helping customers replace and retire legacy systems, which tend to obviously improve the funding and the budgeting for Box as well. s but in that seven-figure category, we were not happy about those results. We are seeing those seven-figure deals in both our Q and Q pipeline. So, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get the majority of those things closed throughout the next couple of quarters into Q. And we'll see the details show up. t of the previously mentioned churn event creates a significant headwind to Q billings. Finally, as we stated throughout FY, the final payments associated with our enhanced developer fee were billed from Q to Q representing an additional couple million-dollar headwind to Q billings. As such, Q will have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison and we expect Q billings growth to be in the low single digit range before returning to more normalized growth rates for the remainder of FY. ry and our prior expectations were based around those numbers. I would also just say that certainly, there are gonna be other factors and a lot of puts and takes in the business that relate to and have an impact on FY growth.  hat were some of the original use cases that they thought they were gonna realize and why weren't they able to meet those targets or realize those use cases? What were some of the unforeseen circumstances they ran into?  management with new metadata solutions and Box platform updates.

From our conversations with our largest customers, it's apparent that they have a wealth of manual business processes primed for automation. We've heard overwhelming feedback from our customers that they want simpler ways to consume workflow automation natively within Box. And this year we'll be launching an all-new Box relay built from the ground up by leveraging Box's automation capabilities announced at BoxWorks. the seven-figure deals to slip and the sales cycles to lengthen there? And do you anticipate that to be a kinda trend going forward? And I guess, can you talk about the close rates on those slip deals for the first month of the first new year? Thanks.  to grow at a healthy clip and invest in the capacity and pipeline to put up continued growth based on what we're expecting to do this year. So, feeling pretty good about this sort of -- all of the inputs that would go into putting up those healthy growth rates over time. And I would say that when we get through FY, which we did give formal guidance around, would expect to see fairly consistent improvement in our operating margins between this year that we're just entering now and FY. So, call it roughly  basis points or so of margin expansion in each of FY and FY. hether the customers direct their channel is again not the big focus versus making sure customers really use us as a cloud content management platform. We'll certainly reflect that in our comments as we go forward this year. But you will see the partnership mix continue to evolve again to bring in more of these system integrators as we're driving much bigger and more strategic solutions to our customers. an be pretty variable from quarter to quarter for a variety of factors such as payment durations and customer-driven changes to the timing of large renewals. So, I wouldn't necessarily think about the commentary we gave around billings as a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our business. with cloud content management through our go-to-market efforts. Let's start first with building the category-defining cloud content management platform. When we look around the world, digital transformation is more urgent for enterprises than ever. Companies today are working across a diverse network of global partners that demand seamless collaboration anytime at any place. Markets are hyper-competitive and to compete, companies need to move faster in everything that they do. Further, every enterprise across every industry is dealing with massive cybersecurity and compliance challenges.  the sort of competitive environment or the types of win rates that we've been seeing over the past several quarters. cognition standard under the modified retrospective transition method. Having adopted ASC  for this fiscal year under the modified retrospective transition method, all Q year-over-year comparisons are made against Q results a year ago, which were under ASC  unless otherwise stated. Please refer to our press release and the supplemental financial deck on our investor relations website for a reconciliation of our financial results under ASC  compared to ASC . With that, let me hand it over to Aaron. nna be really focused on growing in the regions where we are seeing better performance, such as most of the US in the field, as well as in Japan. And then as we start to see some of these things we're doing across the business roll out we may add headcount to other regions as well as that productivity improves. So, we are gonna be very, very focused on driving productivity improvements across the globe, particularly in the fields in the coming year. And there's a few different areas that we're really focused on here. ors and our work with the larger technology integrators of the likes of Excentra, Deloitte, et cetera. But we really wanted to make sure that we covered the broader evolution that's happening with our go-to-market efforts, which is much more about how do we take the full powered Box to our customers and drive upsells with add-on products. p or ticking down relative to the competition? , we're seeing that more of our sales reps are driving add-on product sales really driving much more strategic relationships with customers. But I would say that we're disappointed with the speed at which this is rolling out throughout the business. We just did our sales kickoff about two weeks ago and a really kinda great opportunity obviously reenergized the entire team and really bring to life some incredible examples from throughout FY of very large strategic transactions we're able to drive. opportunity in this account in particular. Unfortunately, a miss-match to the prior set of use cases and the unique structure that was created there yet again driven by the prior leadership. So definitely a one-off from our perspective. Not something that we see any kinda consistent trend on but something that we're really focused on recovering even with this specific customer in driving future growth with. st a function of educating the sales force? orry. Around the $ million headwind you referenced, how do you expect those deals to play out over the course of a year and any other color you can provide us in helping us get a sense of how you arrive at that $ million headwind? ncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are being made as of today, February , , and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise them should they change or cease to be up to date. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release and in the related PowerPoint presentation, which can be found on the investor relations page of our website. se complexities. Although external factors did influence a couple of these deals, such as one of the seven-figure deals were delayed because of a large merger. Another because of the government shutdown. But most of these, almost all of these deals are still in play in the pipeline and set to close throughout FY. lion related to a large customer that's reducing it's spend. That on top of the midpoint of your guidance would be about $ million, which would be a % growth rate next year in line with what you've done in FY or realistically, a deceleration from the % growth adjusted for ASC  this year. You had discussed in the past quarter and definitely the analyst days seeing an acceleration in revenue growth next year. So just help me square these two observations together and why even adding in the moving parts, that still wouldn't amount to an acceleration. Thanks. came in at .% versus .% a year ago and .% last quarter. As a reminder, this past year we made some upfront investments to expand our data center footprint based on the demand we've been seeing and the impact to our gross margins in FY were in line with our original expectations. We were pleased to see a slight improvement in price per seat on a year-over-year basis, mainly as a result of higher add-on product detach rates. We now have  million paid users. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, in FY we will be migrating our data center footprint to significantly lower cost regions, which will accomplish three primary goals, supporting our growth to multi-exabyte scale addressing complex customer compliance requirements and saving tens of millions of dollars over the subsequent three-year period. d then eventually suites to our customers, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity just within our existing customer base, multiple billions of dollars of revenue just within our existing customer base, especially at the top customers.  including at least one add-on product compared to % a year ago. We're confident our solution selling strategy is working and now we need to aggressively drive more standardization across the business. To drive more unified global execution across all of our sales segments, we've been improving our sales training and processes. And over the past six months, we've hired or promoted new sales leaders in key growth regions across North America and EMEA. With these investments and building on the progress we saw in FY, we remain more confident than ever in the cloud content management opportunity. As we kick off fiscal ', we are focused on two key objectives to drive our next days of growth on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. channel partners. We didn't hear that this quarter, is there anything to read into that? Has anything changed with the health of the business with channel partners? iness and in FY we are targeting our first year of delivering non-GAAP profitability. For the first quarter of fiscal , we are setting revenue guidance in the range of - million. Note that Q has three fewer days than Q, which creates a revenue headwind of a little more than  million versus Q but does not impact year-over-year comparisons. While we don't typically guide to billings, we want to provide some color around how we expect billings to trend throughout the year. While we generally expect our revenue and billings growth rates to track roughly in line, year-over-year comparisons of this metric can be variable from quarter to quarter and thus is not always a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum of our business. ont. So, we now have the key positions that we have been searching for filled in North America and EMEA. And so those three factors, the operational product and leadership side should really help drive these productivity improvements. You should start to see that even as soon as the first half of the year particularly in the big deal growth outcomes. e right growth rate is to grow our sales force, which is the biggest driver of the overall spend and I think variability in terms of the type of leverage that we'll see in the coming years as sales and marketing is probably the line item that's gonna be most impacted and where we expect to drive most of the leverage. Where if we are seeing pipeline and actual sales and performance in certain regions, then we will likely invest more in those regions. And if not, then you'll likely see more profitability. hen in terms of just a bundling in terms of sorta driving, I guess you could call it a cumulative add-on. How are you thinking about rolling these out?   result of the move to solutions selling. The growth rate's actually held pretty consistent throughout the year. You added some color around billings trajectory in Q but I'm just wondering if you're still expecting solutions selling in the move to larger deals to provide more of a back-ended seasonal pattern going forward? l our articles, The Motley Fool does not assume any responsibility for your use of this content, and we strongly encourage you to do your own research, including listening to the call yourself and reading the company's SEC filings.

What did you see and where you did roll out the bundles and how is that impacting how you're thinking about the bundling this year and the timing of when those actually do roll out? e sales reps that have been environment selling kinda end to end solutions for customers. Oftentimes that can lead to as pulling candidates out of different kinds of companies than maybe we've traditionally recruited from but overall, this is all sort of priced into our expectations from a cost and sales and marketing standpoint. p plan incentives that we have in place just to further align that with our solution selling strategy. I think we've been pretty pleased with the way that's showed up this past year in add-on products and generally in large deals. So, the second component is around the product capabilities. We are gonna be making Box Relay generally available in the first half of this year. The new Box Relay, as well as Box Shield in the second half. t we've already seen strong early signal from our customers that that is a better way to purchase and use the full breadth of Box's capabilities. t we again kicked off last year. So last year we kind of -- was the start of this evolution and again, we're not satisfied with the complete speed in which we're doing this but we're seeing very strong early success and now we're just building on that momentum coming into this year and again, really optimistic about the results. rigor, as well as the introduction of our product suites we believe, is going to be very helpful in increasing in the momentum there. Happy with the early signs that we're seeing, and we do expect to see some recovery on this within the first half of this year. But again, not satisfied with the Q results, which is driving a big part of that revenue guidance. e to be faster than the growth of our sales force as well. And that's certainly been the trend over time also. In terms of how it relates to the productivity in some of the trends we've seen and anytime you think about a productivity metric and not seeing all of the work that you're doing or the numbers, but I'd say the user growth is probably not as meaningful as large deal growth or billings revenue to get a sense of kinda the traction and success in the sales force. igital workplace and powering digital business processes across the extended enterprise. To do this, our focus for the past year has been to evolve from selling Box as a tool for file sharing and storage, to consultative selling Box as a cloud content management platform for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities. Our solution selling strategy is focused on ensuring that new and existing customers see the full use cases and possibilities with cloud content management tied to significant business outcomes in the form of IT cost savings, business process acceleration, and lower security and compliance risk. han we would've liked in FY. It does put even more of a need for that reacceleration on us but when we look at the opportunity, when we look at our customer base, when we look at our leadership position and our add-on products that we have, this is something that we're very confident in continuing to drive. tunately, due to the complexity of some of these transactions, some of that is not fully within our control. I'd say, due to the kinds of customers we're talking about where the intellectual property that's within their files and their data is very sensitive. Could be client records, could be government data and information. It just puts a very high threshold on the security review, the compliance review, the data privacy reviews of our customers, which often involves a pretty broad set of individuals and parts of the organization that we have to go and work through.   do you think you need to revisit the sales people that you're hiring? Are you looking for maybe a more seasoned enterprise sales candidates going forward that might be higher cost? platform. While the majority of our customers' leverage Box today for secure collaboration and productivity, we know the big opportunity is to power our customers' digital business processes in the cloud. Within our existing customer base alone, there are billions of dollars in potential revenue upside as our customers begin to leverage Box's full set of capabilities across their organizations. cution and inconsistency we've seen that over time we should be able to grow that as a percentage of our overall revenue as well. ypes of sales cycles, we do see way greater customer retention. Obviously, much larger deal sizes. And then ultimately, so much more of our differentiation is able to benefit from these deals as well. We do expect that this becomes the bulk of our business as we reach one billion in revenue and beyond. But it is an evolution to get there and it's something that, again, we're not satisfied with the speed at which we're driving that execution through the whole company, but we are seeing some incredible pockets of success that we now want to go replicate and drive more uniform execution around. ere our add-on product and solution selling strategies were successful in Q driving  deals about $, or more include, a seven-figure deal in Q with a major technology company in the Fortune  that purchased Box Governance, Keysafe, and Platform, accounting for over % of their deal and transforming how they are streamlining processes around content across the organization. We also achieved a new ELA with Heidrick & Struggles, a long-standing Box customer where they purchase Box Skills, Box Multizone, and Box Platform to better coordinate between distributed global offices in their effort to find and close top executive candidates faster. e expect roughly the same, particularly as we grow. A larger portion of what we ultimately bill comes from renewals, so you probably won't' see us move the needle significantly given the current scale. So, should we expect to see similar trends but there to be a little bit of a shift from Q into Q. rowth of our customers and that requires us to move into much more scalable data center facilities in addition to our hybrid cloud usage of public cloud partners. And so, as a result of that, that means we have to operate out of two extra data centers from a redundancy standpoint temporarily while we're making that migration happen, which obviously has an impact on gross margin as Dylan mentioned. all.

But overall, we have not changed our view of the momentum and the pipeline that we're seeing in the business.  l see a collection of these add-on products that are sold to customers, which will obviously be more than any individual add-on product sale.  to close. We're not seeing this as more general trend across our larger deals beyond what we had already been seeing in the business and expecting.  with each of these factors representing a roughly $ million headwind to FY revenue versus our prior expectations. Additionally, one of our customers significantly reduced its spend with us upon its renewal earlier this month as they did not realize the full value of their initial use cases. This was a unique customer situation which will represent a revenue headwind of approximately $ million in FY. We expect our FY non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of negative $. to positive $. on approximately  million diluted shares. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of negative $. to negative $. on approximately  million shares. , the fact that we're obviously onboarding new reps and then the need to continue to improve our sales rigor and processes, that is taking longer than we'd like to have the full dent on our revenue growth that we would expect. So again, we're not satisfied with the results however we have an incredible amount of confidence based on the early trends that we're seeing within the customer base. A lot of customers that we're talking to about cloud content management and how that's going to impact how they transform their businesses and thus we see the size of the opportunity going forward. es business processes, powers workplace collaboration, and protects an enterprise's most valuable information while also working across the best of breed modern enterprise IT stack. Heading into FY, we are focused on extending the core capabilities that differentiate Box as a cloud content management platform and refining our solution selling motion to drive more consistent execution across the business. At the same time, we're targeting our first year of non-GAAP profitability showing further leverage in the business as we continue on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Dylan. t our market opportunity and cloud content management combined with our increasingly differentiated product portfolio will allow us to achieve faster growth rates over time than what we're anticipating in FY. While our Q FY sales results led us to lower our revenue expectations for FY, we're encouraged by the early traction we are seeing in our solution selling strategy. We are focused on driving a reacceleration in topline growth in order to achieve our target of one billion in revenue for the full year of fiscal '. With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?  in our win rates and in our win notifications around being able to help retire and shut down legacy document management and storage infrastructure. of and market adoption of our product, our markets and market size, our operating leverage, our expectations regarding maintaining positive free cash flow and future profitability, our planned investments and growth strategies, our ability to achieve our long-term revenue and other operating model targets and expected timing and benefits of our new products and partnerships. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and actual events or results may differ materially.  expected in Q. And that's how it would roll through the year on the revenue front. It does take -- we basically have a few different categories of deals depending on our confidence in closing those deals from committed to different probabilities associated with that and so it's really looking at that weighted expected impact of those deals that are in those kinda firmer categories versus what ultimately happened in the fourth quarter.  data governance capabilities, and open platform, will only continue to get stronger over time as we move customers from using Box as a productivity and collaboration tool to really a cloud content management platform. w are you thinking about that trade-off and the potential to maybe push for more growth going forward here? ide of California, which is one of the other kinda key points of this is we want more scalability with our data center footprint in lower cost locations. And that's a core factor that will then ultimately lead to better gross margin performance over time. ve seen. Just high-level US as it's our largest region, that was pretty solid overall in terms of year-on-year performance where we saw kinda the coast, west coast and east coast regions leading the charge and central and south regions had been ramping with lower productivity currently.  that was not particularly strong for us. So, would expect probably to see growth or contribution to overall billings to breakdown in the kinda mid-teens in Q. Low to mid-teens in Q and Q. And then mid to high s in Q. digital supply chain where applications like Box will be used across lines of business from marketing to production and financial operations.

Our focus on operational efficiency drove our Q non-GAAP operating margin to a solid  percentage point improvement year-over-year coming in at positive % versus negative % a year ago. trong continued momentum in the $, plus deal segment, and we were encouraged by the strength of the seven-figure deals in our pipeline ahead of Q, we ultimately underperformed against our seven-figure deal expectations in the quarter. These more complex enterprise deals are taking longer to close and as a result, a few moved out of the quarter and into pipeline throughout this year. Additionally, as we previously shared, we saw weakens in EMEA throughout FY. And in Q, experienced a greater impact from this weakness than we anticipated. at international revenue? Thanks, guys.\",\"wever, those customers are still in the pipeline for this year, tend to be very large, regulated customers, often in banking or government agencies or life sciences where the deal tends to be more complex in nature from a security legal compliance standpoint. But overall, we have not changed our view of the momentum and the pipeline that we're seeing in the business. s but in that seven-figure category, we were not happy about those results. We are seeing those seven-figure deals in both our Q and Q pipeline. So, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get the majority of those things closed throughout the next couple of quarters into Q. And we'll see the details show up.  t we've already seen strong early signal from our customers that that is a better way to purchase and use the full breadth of Box's capabilities. y driven by the strategic nature of these transactions and we're working to make sure that they can happen as smoothly as possible.

And as a note, the miss in the seven-figure deal translates through both the k and the k deal segments because it's a cumulative number.  seat basis are the tailwind that we get from the incremental value from these add-on products and a higher value use cases offset by these larger deals with more seats as we tend to give volume discounting. hether the customers direct their channel is again not the big focus versus making sure customers really use us as a cloud content management platform.

To solve this, we will be launched Box Shield as an add-on product later this year. Box Shield will bring intelligent threat detection and content classification natively into Box. We're already hearing from prospective customers that Shield will be transformational to their security and risk posture in protecting critical intellectual property. FY is setting up to be the most exciting year for product innovation in Box's history.

This is an ecosystem where it's a kinda co-sell model, both direct and with partners. Fujitsu is one of them, including IBM and many other kinda major retailers in Japan. So, the growth -- we are seeing a kind of healthy relationship with Fujitsu. Both as a customer as well as a partner in that ecosystem. I'd say the broader partner ecosystem in Japan is performing very strong and we're seeing really strong results from that region.  data governance capabilities, and open platform, will only continue to get stronger over time as we move customers from using Box as a productivity and collaboration tool to really a cloud content management platform. rigor, as well as the introduction of our product suites we believe, is going to be very helpful in increasing in the momentum there. Happy with the early signs that we're seeing, and we do expect to see some recovery on this within the first half of this year. But again, not satisfied with the Q results, which is driving a big part of that revenue guidance. with cloud content management through our go-to-market efforts. Let's start first with building the category-defining cloud content management platform. When we look around the world, digital transformation is more urgent for enterprises than ever. Companies today are working across a diverse network of global partners that demand seamless collaboration anytime at any place.

What did you see and where you did roll out the bundles and how is that impacting how you're thinking about the bundling this year and the timing of when those actually do roll out? t of the previously mentioned churn event creates a significant headwind to Q billings. Finally, as we stated throughout FY, the final payments associated with our enhanced developer fee were billed from Q to Q representing an additional couple million-dollar headwind to Q billings. As such, Q will have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison and we expect Q billings growth to be in the low single digit range before returning to more normalized growth rates for the remainder of FY. d then eventually suites to our customers, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity just within our existing customer base, multiple billions of dollars of revenue just within our existing customer base, especially at the top customers. orry. Around the $ million headwind you referenced, how do you expect those deals to play out over the course of a year and any other color you can provide us in helping us get a sense of how you arrive at that $ million headwind? rowth of our customers and that requires us to move into much more scalable data center facilities in addition to our hybrid cloud usage of public cloud partners. And so, as a result of that, that means we have to operate out of two extra data centers from a redundancy standpoint temporarily while we're making that migration happen, which obviously has an impact on gross margin as Dylan mentioned.  including at least one add-on product compared to % a year ago. We're confident our solution selling strategy is working and now we need to aggressively drive more standardization across the business. To drive more unified global execution across all of our sales segments, we've been improving our sales training and processes. And over the past six months, we've hired or promoted new sales leaders in key growth regions across North America and EMEA. With these investments and building on the progress we saw in FY, we remain more confident than ever in the cloud content management opportunity. As we kick off fiscal ', we are focused on two key objectives to drive our next days of growth on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. p or ticking down relative to the competition? t we again kicked off last year. So last year we kind of -- was the start of this evolution and again, we're not satisfied with the complete speed in which we're doing this but we're seeing very strong early success and now we're just building on that momentum coming into this year and again, really optimistic about the results. hen in terms of just a bundling in terms of sorta driving, I guess you could call it a cumulative add-on. How are you thinking about rolling these out?  to now much more of a strategic platform where customers are automating their business processes where in many cases they're dealing with much more regulated information where compliance and security even more important, where content might even go out and reach through their manufacturing processes or supply chains or customer base. And the fact that they're able to shut down legacy systems. tinuing to make sure we can go and drive solutions sales into our customers and much bigger transactions into our accounts. ch as helping customers replace and retire legacy systems, which tend to obviously improve the funding and the budgeting for Box as well. cution and inconsistency we've seen that over time we should be able to grow that as a percentage of our overall revenue as well. ar too difficult to share content and manage business processes across the extended enterprise in addition to being too costly and complex for the digital age. The enterprise content management and storage infrastructure markets represent $ billion in opportunity and Box is the only cloud-native platform built to power the next generation of workloads as they rapidly move from on-prem to the cloud. Entering FY, we have the most exciting product roadmap in our company's history focused entirely on enabling our customers to power their digital business processes and to retire legacy content management systems.  se complexities. Although external factors did influence a couple of these deals, such as one of the seven-figure deals were delayed because of a large merger. Another because of the government shutdown. But most of these, almost all of these deals are still in play in the pipeline and set to close throughout FY.   to close. We're not seeing this as more general trend across our larger deals beyond what we had already been seeing in the business and expecting. han we would've liked in FY. It does put even more of a need for that reacceleration on us but when we look at the opportunity, when we look at our customer base, when we look at our leadership position and our add-on products that we have, this is something that we're very confident in continuing to drive. es business processes, powers workplace collaboration, and protects an enterprise's most valuable information while also working across the best of breed modern enterprise IT stack. Heading into FY, we are focused on extending the core capabilities that differentiate Box as a cloud content management platform and refining our solution selling motion to drive more consistent execution across the business. At the same time, we're targeting our first year of non-GAAP profitability showing further leverage in the business as we continue on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Dylan. nd. So those are two separate categories that are mutually exclusive, each about $ million.  with each of these factors representing a roughly $ million headwind to FY revenue versus our prior expectations. Additionally, one of our customers significantly reduced its spend with us upon its renewal earlier this month as they did not realize the full value of their initial use cases. This was a unique customer situation which will represent a revenue headwind of approximately $ million in FY. We expect our FY non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of negative $. to positive $. on approximately  million diluted shares. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of negative $. to negative $. on approximately  million shares. iness and in FY we are targeting our first year of delivering non-GAAP profitability. For the first quarter of fiscal , we are setting revenue guidance in the range of - million. Note that Q has three fewer days than Q, which creates a revenue headwind of a little more than  million versus Q but does not impact year-over-year comparisons. While we don't typically guide to billings, we want to provide some color around how we expect billings to trend throughout the year. While we generally expect our revenue and billings growth rates to track roughly in line, year-over-year comparisons of this metric can be variable from quarter to quarter and thus is not always a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum of our business.  in just the go-to-market. And I believe you ended the year at about  quotas carrying. If I kinda correlate that back, then to the billings guidance sort of implied also being kinda in the low-teens there. What are just -- if you kinda walk through the math there, kinda how you're thinking about sales productivity because obviously this skew you made a lot of changes. How are you thinking about sales productivity this coming year versus this last year and kinda the puts and takes versus just call it the headcount side? And then one quick follow-up to that. an be pretty variable from quarter to quarter for a variety of factors such as payment durations and customer-driven changes to the timing of large renewals. So, I wouldn't necessarily think about the commentary we gave around billings as a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our business. , we're seeing that more of our sales reps are driving add-on product sales really driving much more strategic relationships with customers. But I would say that we're disappointed with the speed at which this is rolling out throughout the business. We just did our sales kickoff about two weeks ago and a really kinda great opportunity obviously reenergized the entire team and really bring to life some incredible examples from throughout FY of very large strategic transactions we're able to drive. ont. So, we now have the key positions that we have been searching for filled in North America and EMEA. And so those three factors, the operational product and leadership side should really help drive these productivity improvements. You should start to see that even as soon as the first half of the year particularly in the big deal growth outcomes. ting gross margin throughout FY to range from -%. Once we complete this migration and as we continue to drive these efficiencies, we expect gross margin to trend back up toward the mid-s. Q was another successful quarter of driving operational efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were . million representing % of revenue, a significant improvement from % in the prior year, which includes a roughly % benefit related to the adoption of ASC . Looking ahead, we expect to drive more leverage in sales and marketing as we gain greater efficiencies from our solution selling strategy. ypes of sales cycles, we do see way greater customer retention. Obviously, much larger deal sizes. And then ultimately, so much more of our differentiation is able to benefit from these deals as well. We do expect that this becomes the bulk of our business as we reach one billion in revenue and beyond. But it is an evolution to get there and it's something that, again, we're not satisfied with the speed at which we're driving that execution through the whole company, but we are seeing some incredible pockets of success that we now want to go replicate and drive more uniform execution around.  expected in Q. And that's how it would roll through the year on the revenue front. It does take -- we basically have a few different categories of deals depending on our confidence in closing those deals from committed to different probabilities associated with that and so it's really looking at that weighted expected impact of those deals that are in those kinda firmer categories versus what ultimately happened in the fourth quarter. e right growth rate is to grow our sales force, which is the biggest driver of the overall spend and I think variability in terms of the type of leverage that we'll see in the coming years as sales and marketing is probably the line item that's gonna be most impacted and where we expect to drive most of the leverage. Where if we are seeing pipeline and actual sales and performance in certain regions, then we will likely invest more in those regions. And if not, then you'll likely see more profitability. tunately, due to the complexity of some of these transactions, some of that is not fully within our control. I'd say, due to the kinds of customers we're talking about where the intellectual property that's within their files and their data is very sensitive. Could be client records, could be government data and information. It just puts a very high threshold on the security review, the compliance review, the data privacy reviews of our customers, which often involves a pretty broad set of individuals and parts of the organization that we have to go and work through. onna be our ability to bring the best workflow automation capabilities to our customers for content management. That will then allow us to say with workflow, data governance, platform, and eventually our advanced security with Shield, you can then buy that as a suite of capabilities from Box to really help with the digital transformation. So that's already been tested more or less in market through customer conversations, but we want to make that a packaged offering that we can bring to our entire customer base. a couple of numbers there. I think overall when we look at the broader base of large deals, especially the $, plus segment, which are -- while they don't represent the full impact of our CCM platform being sold to customers, they are often representative of the kinds of customers that are using Box in more strategic ways. And we have seen that base of customers grow at about a % basis year-over-year. arter, which is up from the high-s a year ago. p plan incentives that we have in place just to further align that with our solution selling strategy. I think we've been pretty pleased with the way that's showed up this past year in add-on products and generally in large deals. So, the second component is around the product capabilities. We are gonna be making Box Relay generally available in the first half of this year. The new Box Relay, as well as Box Shield in the second half. ere our add-on product and solution selling strategies were successful in Q driving  deals about $, or more include, a seven-figure deal in Q with a major technology company in the Fortune  that purchased Box Governance, Keysafe, and Platform, accounting for over % of their deal and transforming how they are streamlining processes around content across the organization. We also achieved a new ELA with Heidrick & Struggles, a long-standing Box customer where they purchase Box Skills, Box Multizone, and Box Platform to better coordinate between distributed global offices in their effort to find and close top executive candidates faster. of and market adoption of our product, our markets and market size, our operating leverage, our expectations regarding maintaining positive free cash flow and future profitability, our planned investments and growth strategies, our ability to achieve our long-term revenue and other operating model targets and expected timing and benefits of our new products and partnerships. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and actual events or results may differ materially. opportunity in this account in particular. Unfortunately, a miss-match to the prior set of use cases and the unique structure that was created there yet again driven by the prior leadership. So definitely a one-off from our perspective. Not something that we see any kinda consistent trend on but something that we're really focused on recovering even with this specific customer in driving future growth with. adership in some of our kinda sub-regional segments that are running kinda key countries within EMEA. So overall, we have made some investments in very strong sales leadership and talent to help with EMEA broadly. Solution selling and really just move from enabling customers to use Box for file sharing and collaboration to really using the full suite of Box's capabilities. cognition standard under the modified retrospective transition method. Having adopted ASC  for this fiscal year under the modified retrospective transition method, all Q year-over-year comparisons are made against Q results a year ago, which were under ASC  unless otherwise stated. Please refer to our press release and the supplemental financial deck on our investor relations website for a reconciliation of our financial results under ASC  compared to ASC . With that, let me hand it over to Aaron.  well. Other parts of performance in FY as well as expectations for FY. platform. While the majority of our customers' leverage Box today for secure collaboration and productivity, we know the big opportunity is to power our customers' digital business processes in the cloud. Within our existing customer base alone, there are billions of dollars in potential revenue upside as our customers begin to leverage Box's full set of capabilities across their organizations. channel partners. We didn't hear that this quarter, is there anything to read into that? Has anything changed with the health of the business with channel partners? igital workplace and powering digital business processes across the extended enterprise. To do this, our focus for the past year has been to evolve from selling Box as a tool for file sharing and storage, to consultative selling Box as a cloud content management platform for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities. Our solution selling strategy is focused on ensuring that new and existing customers see the full use cases and possibilities with cloud content management tied to significant business outcomes in the form of IT cost savings, business process acceleration, and lower security and compliance risk. , the fact that we're obviously onboarding new reps and then the need to continue to improve our sales rigor and processes, that is taking longer than we'd like to have the full dent on our revenue growth that we would expect. So again, we're not satisfied with the results however we have an incredible amount of confidence based on the early trends that we're seeing within the customer base. A lot of customers that we're talking to about cloud content management and how that's going to impact how they transform their businesses and thus we see the size of the opportunity going forward. at international revenue? Thanks, guys.  will be launched in the middle of this year and will be sold as a stand-alone skew in addition to being a part of the new product suites we'll be offering later this year. In FY, we will also focus on enabling intelligent content management by advancing our metadata, skills, and platform capabilities. Combined, these capabilities enable customers to retire legacy ECM technology and integrate Box into ERP systems, line of business apps, business processes, and more. For instance, one customer we closed in Q, Lineage Logistics, international warehousing, and logistics company, will leverage Box Skills through Box platform to power new warehouse automation initiatives. s that we'd expected to close in the fourth quarter originally. As we sort of enter the quarter versus what ultimately happened, and then making adjustments for the deals that are near-term that we have visibility into the earlier part of the year. ors and our work with the larger technology integrators of the likes of Excentra, Deloitte, et cetera. But we really wanted to make sure that we covered the broader evolution that's happening with our go-to-market efforts, which is much more about how do we take the full powered Box to our customers and drive upsells with add-on products. hat were some of the original use cases that they thought they were gonna realize and why weren't they able to meet those targets or realize those use cases? What were some of the unforeseen circumstances they ran into? -GAAP profitability and our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow as we continue to drive strong leverage in our business model. We delivered revenue of $. million in Q up % year-over-year with % of Q's revenue coming from regions outside the United States driven by strong performance in Japan throughout the year. We closed  deals over $, versus  a year ago,  deals over $,, which was flat with a year ago, and two deals over $ million versus nine a year ago. Fourth quarter billings came in at $. million representing % calculated and % adjusted billings growth year-over-year following short of our original expectation of growth in the mid-s.  that was not particularly strong for us. So, would expect probably to see growth or contribution to overall billings to breakdown in the kinda mid-teens in Q. Low to mid-teens in Q and Q. And then mid to high s in Q.  rates in those use cases that are more kinda cloud content management in nature. So particularly as there are a greater set of products associated with those deals as much as -- you'd always mention they tend to be more complex and, in many cases, longer deal cycles. he focus here is making sure that we can really get very aggressive with all of our sales team on exactly what it takes to go and sell these much larger deals, making sure everybody's equipped with the right content messages, training to do this. It's something that we're building off of a very strong foundation, fortunately, but we want to invest in this even further and get even more rigorous with our training enablement and sales processes. competitive environment? Thanks. ve seen.

And three, advanced security classification and thread detection with Box shield. From our conversations with our largest customers, it's apparent that they have a wealth of manual business processes primed for automation. We've heard overwhelming feedback from our customers that they want simpler ways to consume workflow automation natively within Box. And this year we'll be launching an all-new Box relay built from the ground up by leveraging Box's automation capabilities announced at BoxWorks. e sales reps that have been environment selling kinda end to end solutions for customers. Oftentimes that can lead to as pulling candidates out of different kinds of companies than maybe we've traditionally recruited from but overall, this is all sort of priced into our expectations from a cost and sales and marketing standpoint. came in at .% versus .% a year ago and .% last quarter. As a reminder, this past year we made some upfront investments to expand our data center footprint based on the demand we've been seeing and the impact to our gross margins in FY were in line with our original expectations. We were pleased to see a slight improvement in price per seat on a year-over-year basis, mainly as a result of higher add-on product detach rates. We now have  million paid users. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, in FY we will be migrating our data center footprint to significantly lower cost regions, which will accomplish three primary goals, supporting our growth to multi-exabyte scale addressing complex customer compliance requirements and saving tens of millions of dollars over the subsequent three-year period. lion related to a large customer that's reducing it's spend.

Thanks. our years, we've been adding additional value-added products like data governance, our platform capabilities, advanced security capabilities, add-on solutions around the core.

Today's call is being webcast and will also be available for replay on our investor relations website at www.box.com/investors. Our webcast will be audio only. However, supplemental slides are now available for download from our website. We'll also post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle @boxincir.  do you think you need to revisit the sales people that you're hiring? Are you looking for maybe a more seasoned enterprise sales candidates going forward that might be higher cost? -GAAP profitability and our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow as we continue to drive strong leverage in our business model. We delivered revenue of $. million in Q up % year-over-year with % of Q's revenue coming from regions outside the United States driven by strong performance in Japan throughout the year. We closed  deals over $, versus  a year ago,  deals over $,, which was flat with a year ago, and two deals over $ million versus nine a year ago. Fourth quarter billings came in at $. million representing % calculated and % adjusted billings growth year-over-year following short of our original expectation of growth in the mid-s. y driven by the strategic nature of these transactions and we're working to make sure that they can happen as smoothly as possible. And that we're constantly improving our own internal processes to drive these as well as the sales rigor and the operational rigor to make sure that we can get these across the finish line. I think the k deal segment and the k deal segments did show very healthy growth on a year-over-year basis. And as a note, the miss in the seven-figure deal translates through both the k and the k deal segments because it's a cumulative number.  the sort of competitive environment or the types of win rates that we've been seeing over the past several quarters.  years, you've grown quota carrying headcount well in excess of revenue growth and certainly in excess of billings growth. You would think if the solution sale selling is working, it would certainly be evident in your fiscal fourth quarter where these solution-based large deals really accumulate and seasonally are strong. he focus here is making sure that we can really get very aggressive with all of our sales team on exactly what it takes to go and sell these much larger deals, making sure everybody's equipped with the right content messages, training to do this. It's something that we're building off of a very strong foundation, fortunately, but we want to invest in this even further and get even more rigorous with our training enablement and sales processes. se complexities. Although external factors did influence a couple of these deals, such as one of the seven-figure deals were delayed because of a large merger. Another because of the government shutdown. But most of these, almost all of these deals are still in play in the pipeline and set to close throughout FY.   result of the move to solutions selling. The growth rate's actually held pretty consistent throughout the year. You added some color around billings trajectory in Q but I'm just wondering if you're still expecting solutions selling in the move to larger deals to provide more of a back-ended seasonal pattern going forward?  to close. We're not seeing this as more general trend across our larger deals beyond what we had already been seeing in the business and expecting. s that we'd expected to close in the fourth quarter originally. As we sort of enter the quarter versus what ultimately happened, and then making adjustments for the deals that are near-term that we have visibility into the earlier part of the year. t of the previously mentioned churn event creates a significant headwind to Q billings. Finally, as we stated throughout FY, the final payments associated with our enhanced developer fee were billed from Q to Q representing an additional couple million-dollar headwind to Q billings. As such, Q will have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison and we expect Q billings growth to be in the low single digit range before returning to more normalized growth rates for the remainder of FY. s but in that seven-figure category, we were not happy about those results. We are seeing those seven-figure deals in both our Q and Q pipeline. So, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get the majority of those things closed throughout the next couple of quarters into Q. And we'll see the details show up. opportunity in this account in particular. Unfortunately, a miss-match to the prior set of use cases and the unique structure that was created there yet again driven by the prior leadership. So definitely a one-off from our perspective. Not something that we see any kinda consistent trend on but something that we're really focused on recovering even with this specific customer in driving future growth with.  including at least one add-on product compared to % a year ago. We're confident our solution selling strategy is working and now we need to aggressively drive more standardization across the business. To drive more unified global execution across all of our sales segments, we've been improving our sales training and processes. And over the past six months, we've hired or promoted new sales leaders in key growth regions across North America and EMEA. With these investments and building on the progress we saw in FY, we remain more confident than ever in the cloud content management opportunity. As we kick off fiscal ', we are focused on two key objectives to drive our next days of growth on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. adership in some of our kinda sub-regional segments that are running kinda key countries within EMEA. So overall, we have made some investments in very strong sales leadership and talent to help with EMEA broadly. Solution selling and really just move from enabling customers to use Box for file sharing and collaboration to really using the full suite of Box's capabilities.  ont. So, we now have the key positions that we have been searching for filled in North America and EMEA. And so those three factors, the operational product and leadership side should really help drive these productivity improvements. You should start to see that even as soon as the first half of the year particularly in the big deal growth outcomes. rigor, as well as the introduction of our product suites we believe, is going to be very helpful in increasing in the momentum there. Happy with the early signs that we're seeing, and we do expect to see some recovery on this within the first half of this year. But again, not satisfied with the Q results, which is driving a big part of that revenue guidance. came in at .% versus .% a year ago and .% last quarter. As a reminder, this past year we made some upfront investments to expand our data center footprint based on the demand we've been seeing and the impact to our gross margins in FY were in line with our original expectations.

These forward-looking statements are being made as of today, February , , and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise them should they change or cease to be up to date. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release and in the related PowerPoint presentation, which can be found on the investor relations page of our website. igital workplace and powering digital business processes across the extended enterprise. To do this, our focus for the past year has been to evolve from selling Box as a tool for file sharing and storage, to consultative selling Box as a cloud content management platform for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities. Our solution selling strategy is focused on ensuring that new and existing customers see the full use cases and possibilities with cloud content management tied to significant business outcomes in the form of IT cost savings, business process acceleration, and lower security and compliance risk. with cloud content management through our go-to-market efforts. Let's start first with building the category-defining cloud content management platform. When we look around the world, digital transformation is more urgent for enterprises than ever. Companies today are working across a diverse network of global partners that demand seamless collaboration anytime at any place. Markets are hyper-competitive and to compete, companies need to move faster in everything that they do. Further, every enterprise across every industry is dealing with massive cybersecurity and compliance challenges. ting gross margin throughout FY to range from -%. Once we complete this migration and as we continue to drive these efficiencies, we expect gross margin to trend back up toward the mid-s. Q was another successful quarter of driving operational efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were . million representing % of revenue, a significant improvement from % in the prior year, which includes a roughly % benefit related to the adoption of ASC . Looking ahead, we expect to drive more leverage in sales and marketing as we gain greater efficiencies from our solution selling strategy.  ve seen. Just high-level US as it's our largest region, that was pretty solid overall in terms of year-on-year performance where we saw kinda the coast, west coast and east coast regions leading the charge and central and south regions had been ramping with lower productivity currently. st a function of educating the sales force?  that was not particularly strong for us. So, would expect probably to see growth or contribution to overall billings to breakdown in the kinda mid-teens in Q. Low to mid-teens in Q and Q. And then mid to high s in Q. rch and development expenses were . million or % of revenue, flat with a year ago as we continue to invest in the enhancement of our product offerings. This included the continued development of Box Relay, Box Shield, and Box Platform. Our general and administrative costs were . million or % of revenue compared to % in Q of last year. We expect to drive continued leverage in G&A as we benefit from greater operational excellence and scale. Our focus on operational efficiency drove our Q non-GAAP operating margin to a solid  percentage point improvement year-over-year coming in at positive % versus negative % a year ago. king it a little more formalized. What did you see and where you did roll out the bundles and how is that impacting how you're thinking about the bundling this year and the timing of when those actually do roll out? the seven-figure deals to slip and the sales cycles to lengthen there? And do you anticipate that to be a kinda trend going forward? And I guess, can you talk about the close rates on those slip deals for the first month of the first new year? Thanks. e sales reps that have been environment selling kinda end to end solutions for customers. Oftentimes that can lead to as pulling candidates out of different kinds of companies than maybe we've traditionally recruited from but overall, this is all sort of priced into our expectations from a cost and sales and marketing standpoint. t we've already seen strong early signal from our customers that that is a better way to purchase and use the full breadth of Box's capabilities. orry. Around the $ million headwind you referenced, how do you expect those deals to play out over the course of a year and any other color you can provide us in helping us get a sense of how you arrive at that $ million headwind? hether the customers direct their channel is again not the big focus versus making sure customers really use us as a cloud content management platform. We'll certainly reflect that in our comments as we go forward this year. But you will see the partnership mix continue to evolve again to bring in more of these system integrators as we're driving much bigger and more strategic solutions to our customers. onna be our ability to bring the best workflow automation capabilities to our customers for content management. That will then allow us to say with workflow, data governance, platform, and eventually our advanced security with Shield, you can then buy that as a suite of capabilities from Box to really help with the digital transformation. So that's already been tested more or less in market through customer conversations, but we want to make that a packaged offering that we can bring to our entire customer base. e right growth rate is to grow our sales force, which is the biggest driver of the overall spend and I think variability in terms of the type of leverage that we'll see in the coming years as sales and marketing is probably the line item that's gonna be most impacted and where we expect to drive most of the leverage. Where if we are seeing pipeline and actual sales and performance in certain regions, then we will likely invest more in those regions. And if not, then you'll likely see more profitability.  in just the go-to-market. And I believe you ended the year at about  quotas carrying. If I kinda correlate that back, then to the billings guidance sort of implied also being kinda in the low-teens there. What are just -- if you kinda walk through the math there, kinda how you're thinking about sales productivity because obviously this skew you made a lot of changes. How are you thinking about sales productivity this coming year versus this last year and kinda the puts and takes versus just call it the headcount side? And then one quick follow-up to that.  will be launched in the middle of this year and will be sold as a stand-alone skew in addition to being a part of the new product suites we'll be offering later this year. In FY, we will also focus on enabling intelligent content management by advancing our metadata, skills, and platform capabilities. Combined, these capabilities enable customers to retire legacy ECM technology and integrate Box into ERP systems, line of business apps, business processes, and more. For instance, one customer we closed in Q, Lineage Logistics, international warehousing, and logistics company, will leverage Box Skills through Box platform to power new warehouse automation initiatives. an be pretty variable from quarter to quarter for a variety of factors such as payment durations and customer-driven changes to the timing of large renewals. So, I wouldn't necessarily think about the commentary we gave around billings as a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our business.  well. Other parts of performance in FY as well as expectations for FY. ere our add-on product and solution selling strategies were successful in Q driving  deals about $, or more include, a seven-figure deal in Q with a major technology company in the Fortune  that purchased Box Governance, Keysafe, and Platform, accounting for over % of their deal and transforming how they are streamlining processes around content across the organization. We also achieved a new ELA with Heidrick & Struggles, a long-standing Box customer where they purchase Box Skills, Box Multizone, and Box Platform to better coordinate between distributed global offices in their effort to find and close top executive candidates faster.  wever, those customers are still in the pipeline for this year, tend to be very large, regulated customers, often in banking or government agencies or life sciences where the deal tends to be more complex in nature from a security legal compliance standpoint. But overall, we have not changed our view of the momentum and the pipeline that we're seeing in the business. nd. So those are two separate categories that are mutually exclusive, each about $ million. trong continued momentum in the $, plus deal segment, and we were encouraged by the strength of the seven-figure deals in our pipeline ahead of Q, we ultimately underperformed against our seven-figure deal expectations in the quarter. These more complex enterprise deals are taking longer to close and as a result, a few moved out of the quarter and into pipeline throughout this year. Additionally, as we previously shared, we saw weakens in EMEA throughout FY. And in Q, experienced a greater impact from this weakness than we anticipated. da start of the whole context of the overall strategy from an IT standpoint looked very different given the prior relationship structure. We had a number of use cases, some higher value than others. Unfortunately, in some of the high-value ones with this new leadership in place there ended up being a cost versus value gap that we couldn't bridge with the new leadership. ormance obligation, the deferred revenue breakdown overall up %. Short-term deferred was up % and long-term deferred was down %. And that's, again, because of -- and the noise in headwind from the long-term deferred was because the impact of that enhanced developer fee, which was a much bigger amount of on our balance sheet a year ago. e expect roughly the same, particularly as we grow. A larger portion of what we ultimately bill comes from renewals, so you probably won't' see us move the needle significantly given the current scale. So, should we expect to see similar trends but there to be a little bit of a shift from Q into Q. t our market opportunity and cloud content management combined with our increasingly differentiated product portfolio will allow us to achieve faster growth rates over time than what we're anticipating in FY. While our Q FY sales results led us to lower our revenue expectations for FY, we're encouraged by the early traction we are seeing in our solution selling strategy. We are focused on driving a reacceleration in topline growth in order to achieve our target of one billion in revenue for the full year of fiscal '. With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?  rates in those use cases that are more kinda cloud content management in nature. So particularly as there are a greater set of products associated with those deals as much as -- you'd always mention they tend to be more complex and, in many cases, longer deal cycles. channel partners. We didn't hear that this quarter, is there anything to read into that? Has anything changed with the health of the business with channel partners? es business processes, powers workplace collaboration, and protects an enterprise's most valuable information while also working across the best of breed modern enterprise IT stack. Heading into FY, we are focused on extending the core capabilities that differentiate Box as a cloud content management platform and refining our solution selling motion to drive more consistent execution across the business. At the same time, we're targeting our first year of non-GAAP profitability showing further leverage in the business as we continue on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Dylan. ch as helping customers replace and retire legacy systems, which tend to obviously improve the funding and the budgeting for Box as well. ry and our prior expectations were based around those numbers. I would also just say that certainly, there are gonna be other factors and a lot of puts and takes in the business that relate to and have an impact on FY growth.  management with new metadata solutions and Box platform updates. And three, advanced security classification and thread detection with Box shield. From our conversations with our largest customers, it's apparent that they have a wealth of manual business processes primed for automation. We've heard overwhelming feedback from our customers that they want simpler ways to consume workflow automation natively within Box. And this year we'll be launching an all-new Box relay built from the ground up by leveraging Box's automation capabilities announced at BoxWorks.   in our win rates and in our win notifications around being able to help retire and shut down legacy document management and storage infrastructure.  with each of these factors representing a roughly $ million headwind to FY revenue versus our prior expectations. Additionally, one of our customers significantly reduced its spend with us upon its renewal earlier this month as they did not realize the full value of their initial use cases. This was a unique customer situation which will represent a revenue headwind of approximately $ million in FY. We expect our FY non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of negative $. to positive $. on approximately  million diluted shares. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of negative $. to negative $. on approximately  million shares.  to grow at a healthy clip and invest in the capacity and pipeline to put up continued growth based on what we're expecting to do this year. So, feeling pretty good about this sort of -- all of the inputs that would go into putting up those healthy growth rates over time. And I would say that when we get through FY, which we did give formal guidance around, would expect to see fairly consistent improvement in our operating margins between this year that we're just entering now and FY. So, call it roughly  basis points or so of margin expansion in each of FY and FY.  seat basis are the tailwind that we get from the incremental value from these add-on products and a higher value use cases offset by these larger deals with more seats as we tend to give volume discounting. ar too difficult to share content and manage business processes across the extended enterprise in addition to being too costly and complex for the digital age. The enterprise content management and storage infrastructure markets represent $ billion in opportunity and Box is the only cloud-native platform built to power the next generation of workloads as they rapidly move from on-prem to the cloud. Entering FY, we have the most exciting product roadmap in our company's history focused entirely on enabling our customers to power their digital business processes and to retire legacy content management systems. rowth of our customers and that requires us to move into much more scalable data center facilities in addition to our hybrid cloud usage of public cloud partners. And so, as a result of that, that means we have to operate out of two extra data centers from a redundancy standpoint temporarily while we're making that migration happen, which obviously has an impact on gross margin as Dylan mentioned. s a little bit higher than in most quarters by the really strong growth that we saw in Japan that we mentioned as virtually all of those deals are through the channel. tinuing to make sure we can go and drive solutions sales into our customers and much bigger transactions into our accounts.  data governance capabilities, and open platform, will only continue to get stronger over time as we move customers from using Box as a productivity and collaboration tool to really a cloud content management platform. platform. While the majority of our customers' leverage Box today for secure collaboration and productivity, we know the big opportunity is to power our customers' digital business processes in the cloud. Within our existing customer base alone, there are billions of dollars in potential revenue upside as our customers begin to leverage Box's full set of capabilities across their organizations. digital supply chain where applications like Box will be used across lines of business from marketing to production and financial operations. We began implementing our solution selling strategy in FY and while we're encouraged by our early progress, we're working to further improve our execution through, number one, improved sales training, rigorous sales processes, and updates to our sales compensation plans tied to solution selling. Two, hiring and promoting experienced world-class sales leadership talent throughout all segments of the field globally. tunately, due to the complexity of some of these transactions, some of that is not fully within our control. I'd say, due to the kinds of customers we're talking about where the intellectual property that's within their files and their data is very sensitive. Could be client records, could be government data and information. It just puts a very high threshold on the security review, the compliance review, the data privacy reviews of our customers, which often involves a pretty broad set of individuals and parts of the organization that we have to go and work through. a couple of numbers there. I think overall when we look at the broader base of large deals, especially the $, plus segment, which are -- while they don't represent the full impact of our CCM platform being sold to customers, they are often representative of the kinds of customers that are using Box in more strategic ways. And we have seen that base of customers grow at about a % basis year-over-year. hat were some of the original use cases that they thought they were gonna realize and why weren't they able to meet those targets or realize those use cases? What were some of the unforeseen circumstances they ran into? ide of California, which is one of the other kinda key points of this is we want more scalability with our data center footprint in lower cost locations. And that's a core factor that will then ultimately lead to better gross margin performance over time. To solve this, we will be launched Box Shield as an add-on product later this year. Box Shield will bring intelligent threat detection and content classification natively into Box. We're already hearing from prospective customers that Shield will be transformational to their security and risk posture in protecting critical intellectual property. FY is setting up to be the most exciting year for product innovation in Box's history. And due to the increasing success of our add-on products, we'll be making it much easier for our customers to adopt the full power of our cloud content management platform by launching new product suites in the first half of FY. cognition standard under the modified retrospective transition method. Having adopted ASC  for this fiscal year under the modified retrospective transition method, all Q year-over-year comparisons are made against Q results a year ago, which were under ASC  unless otherwise stated. Please refer to our press release and the supplemental financial deck on our investor relations website for a reconciliation of our financial results under ASC  compared to ASC . With that, let me hand it over to Aaron. p plan incentives that we have in place just to further align that with our solution selling strategy. I think we've been pretty pleased with the way that's showed up this past year in add-on products and generally in large deals. So, the second component is around the product capabilities. We are gonna be making Box Relay generally available in the first half of this year. The new Box Relay, as well as Box Shield in the second half. d then eventually suites to our customers, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity just within our existing customer base, multiple billions of dollars of revenue just within our existing customer base, especially at the top customers.  expected in Q. And that's how it would roll through the year on the revenue front. It does take -- we basically have a few different categories of deals depending on our confidence in closing those deals from committed to different probabilities associated with that and so it's really looking at that weighted expected impact of those deals that are in those kinda firmer categories versus what ultimately happened in the fourth quarter. , we're seeing that more of our sales reps are driving add-on product sales really driving much more strategic relationships with customers. But I would say that we're disappointed with the speed at which this is rolling out throughout the business. We just did our sales kickoff about two weeks ago and a really kinda great opportunity obviously reenergized the entire team and really bring to life some incredible examples from throughout FY of very large strategic transactions we're able to drive. our years, we've been adding additional value-added products like data governance, our platform capabilities, advanced security capabilities, add-on solutions around the core. What we're finding is as we're moving more toward solutions selling larger transactions, we want to get out of the mode of selling each individual product on a one-off basis to customers and really being able to bring the full suite of Box's cloud content management platform to our customers. t we again kicked off last year. So last year we kind of -- was the start of this evolution and again, we're not satisfied with the complete speed in which we're doing this but we're seeing very strong early success and now we're just building on that momentum coming into this year and again, really optimistic about the results. ypes of sales cycles, we do see way greater customer retention. Obviously, much larger deal sizes. And then ultimately, so much more of our differentiation is able to benefit from these deals as well. We do expect that this becomes the bulk of our business as we reach one billion in revenue and beyond. But it is an evolution to get there and it's something that, again, we're not satisfied with the speed at which we're driving that execution through the whole company, but we are seeing some incredible pockets of success that we now want to go replicate and drive more uniform execution around. l our articles, The Motley Fool does not assume any responsibility for your use of this content, and we strongly encourage you to do your own research, including listening to the call yourself and reading the company's SEC filings.

How are you thinking about rolling these out? ors and our work with the larger technology integrators of the likes of Excentra, Deloitte, et cetera. But we really wanted to make sure that we covered the broader evolution that's happening with our go-to-market efforts, which is much more about how do we take the full powered Box to our customers and drive upsells with add-on products. , the fact that we're obviously onboarding new reps and then the need to continue to improve our sales rigor and processes, that is taking longer than we'd like to have the full dent on our revenue growth that we would expect. So again, we're not satisfied with the results however we have an incredible amount of confidence based on the early trends that we're seeing within the customer base. A lot of customers that we're talking to about cloud content management and how that's going to impact how they transform their businesses and thus we see the size of the opportunity going forward. han we would've liked in FY. It does put even more of a need for that reacceleration on us but when we look at the opportunity, when we look at our customer base, when we look at our leadership position and our add-on products that we have, this is something that we're very confident in continuing to drive. e to be faster than the growth of our sales force as well. And that's certainly been the trend over time also. In terms of how it relates to the productivity in some of the trends we've seen and anytime you think about a productivity metric and not seeing all of the work that you're doing or the numbers, but I'd say the user growth is probably not as meaningful as large deal growth or billings revenue to get a sense of kinda the traction and success in the sales force. es that revenue is gonna have to accelerate to % CAGR over the following two years. And if it is still on the table, what is it that's giving you confidence in that? And then I've got a follow-up for Dylan.  to now much more of a strategic platform where customers are automating their business processes where in many cases they're dealing with much more regulated information where compliance and security even more important, where content might even go out and reach through their manufacturing processes or supply chains or customer base. And the fact that they're able to shut down legacy systems. nna be really focused on growing in the regions where we are seeing better performance, such as most of the US in the field, as well as in Japan. And then as we start to see some of these things we're doing across the business roll out we may add headcount to other regions as well as that productivity improves. So, we are gonna be very, very focused on driving productivity improvements across the globe, particularly in the fields in the coming year. And there's a few different areas that we're really focused on here. iness and in FY we are targeting our first year of delivering non-GAAP profitability. For the first quarter of fiscal , we are setting revenue guidance in the range of - million. Note that Q has three fewer days than Q, which creates a revenue headwind of a little more than  million versus Q but does not impact year-over-year comparisons. While we don't typically guide to billings, we want to provide some color around how we expect billings to trend throughout the year. While we generally expect our revenue and billings growth rates to track roughly in line, year-over-year comparisons of this metric can be variable from quarter to quarter and thus is not always a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum of our business. p or ticking down relative to the competition?\",\"vestments to maximize growth and profitability.

Sixty per cent of working Americans say they don\\u2019t have enough time to do the things they want to do, and a high income is the most reliable predictor of leisure-time physical activity; getting a lot of exercise feels like a luxury and an advantage. Exercise has kept my head clear, my mood even, my body predictable, my energy up. It has also helped me compete in a culture of escalating beauty expectations and increasingly boundless work.

I introduced myself, and she instantly recalibrated her vibrancy to fit the contours of my attention, like a phone screen adjusting its brightness according to the light. \\u201cI\\u2019m really looking forward to spending time,\\u201d she said, looking at me with warm brown eyes. and had brought a male friend.

After the talk, my friend asked me, \\u201cDid it seem like all her advice was predicated on having a lot of money and free time?\\u201d tes almost like a subscription service: the design team plans a six-month season, and clothes drop once a month, sometimes after being teased on Instagram by Haney, who has a winsome smile and an athletic figure and is her brand\\u2019s best model. But the company also has nine stores, with at least two more slated to open this year.

She waited tables at the Border Caf\\u00e9, in Harvard Square, where members of the New England Patriots sometimes came in for fajitas.

There she met Tom Brady and Gisele B\\u00fcndchen. The world, again, seemed huge and astonishing. , I paid a visit. In the entryway to the white-walled, light-filled central building, a corkboard was plastered with photos of dozens of employees\\u2019 dogs. Haney had a beloved Havapoo, named Bowie, who, last year, the week before Haney turned thirty, was hit by a truck, right in front of the office. His photo, decorated with wings and a halo, was perched above the others. Haney now has a miniature Australian shepherd named Juice. (His Instagram handle is @juicedoingthings.) OV has just over a hundred employees in Austin\\u2014their ages seemed to range from plausible college student to mid-thirties.

But both OV and Lululemon appeal to the desire to wear workout clothes around the clock, and Haney has succeeded in part because Wilson\\u2019s ritzy vision\\u2014picture Ocean in black leggings and a rich-mom tank top\\u2014has, for many younger women, become pass\\u00e9.

As a teen-ager, Haney had mostly worn vintage clothes that she altered on her sewing machine, but she started to gravitate toward the idea of a stylish uniform: cropped white T-shirts and simple A-line skirts. She had begun dating a successful restaurateur from Austin named Larry McGuire. Soon after completing the Parsons program, she announced her entrepreneurial plans in a video that she posted on Tumblr. With her ash-blond hair in layers, and a box of Kashi cereal on the shelves behind her, she said that she was starting an activewear brand. \\u201cI\\u2019ve decided to blog about the experience,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbecause I\\u2019ve found that you see a lot of brands that you admire but you don\\u2019t know how they got there.

Now, since labor is the foundation of human society, when it changes radically and rapidly across nations, everything else that connects the human society falls apart as well. As we look around, we can see those old systems, models, and ways of doing things are struggling to survive as a new way of doing things is emerging rapidly. This new way of doing things requires entirely different skill sets and capabilities -- approaches and expectations for the work that many don't even fully understand yet. ill look in terms of the human workforce working alongside (or maybe for) a machine workforce. At the same time, it is also essential to evaluate how entities across nations: their governments, industries, organizations, and academia (NGIOA) are evolving themselves due to competitive pressures and technological breakthroughs. One thing is clear that lifelong careers and job security are disappearing, and this emerging reality is likely to shake up the social safety net.  al climate by making the social safety net a higher strategic priority than it has ever been. That brings us to an important question: are nations preparing the human workforce for what is to come?   is giving rise to an entirely new competitive workforce that is intelligent.

As we see, machines are discovering patterns on their own, and they are learning things themselves. So, when we have intelligent tools that can find novel solutions to the complex challenges facing humanity, then it is a whole new world of machine workforce for which the human workforce is not prepared. It is going to be difficult for humans to evaluate what's left for the human workforce to do as machine workforce takes over.  the speed at which they unfold can be hard to predict for any nation or its decision makers. As a result, preparing the human workforce solely through today\\u2019s work models and technical skills does not guarantee the human workforce the necessary skill set and competencies to compete with the emerging machine workforce that brings many unknowns. oming years as roughly half of the subject knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year technical degree will likely be outdated by the time students graduate.

Besides, a digitally-enabled independent human work is rising. While independent work for humans is nothing new, and self-employment is, still the predominant form of employment in emerging economies, the digital enablement of it is a significant change, as the proportion of independent work that is conducted on digital platforms is proliferating. This is primarily due to the scale, efficiency, and ease of use for the human workforce that these digital platforms enable.

Drones, for example, can automate the inspection of fields for pest or weed outbreaks, and can use high-resolution cameras and algorithmic processing of the images to pick up incipient problems before a farmer or a hired hand might spot them. Another possible application is plant breeding. Breeders currently rely on humans to evaluate seedlings produced by new combinations of already existing varieties. At a large operation, such as the University of Florida\\u2019s strawberry-breeding program, which is run by Vance Whitaker, people must manually inspect thousands of seedlings each year to see if any carries the desirable traits that the breeder is looking for.

They valued corporate loyalty and strongly discouraged employees from leaving for a competitor or starting their own venture. In the Valley, in contrast, information was shared much more freely both within companies and between them. Leaving to start something of your own was not frowned upon. Indeed it was encouraged; established firms helped support or spin off younger ones.   factors, such as employee compensation, retention, taxes, available funding, ease of access to other cities and the weather, the cities that Ms Haidar saw as runners up to first-choice Dallas were Phoenix, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado. The Kauffman Foundation, a think-tank, now ranks the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area as number one in America for startup activity. As each grows, each offers more opportunities for people who decide to move on from their current job. Internationally, Beijing and Shenzhen are hugely important.

But the Valley has always kept climbing, and there are plenty who believe that, unequalled in its wealth and its claim on the world\\u2019s attention, it can go on doing so. Things may currently be unhelpfully overheated; some think a recession might clear out some badly run companies and lower costs for the fitter survivors. But the long-term outlook is cheery. \\u201cFlorence was in its position for more than  years,\\u201d says Mike Volpi of Index Ventures, which invests in startups. \\u201cSilicon Valley still has many years to go.\\u201d  it is no longer the ferment it once was, and it is unlikely it will ever again dominate the technology world in quite the way it has over the past decades.

Other technologies which could conceivably pull power away from the Valley might include blockchains (see Technology Quarterly) or quantum computing. Blockchains are by their nature decentralised; quantum computing could reorient the tech world toward China. . Indeed a startup in a place with cheaper housing and less crowded freeways (even on a comfortable corporate bus with Wi-Fi, a two-hour commute is a pain) can become the poacher.

But when office space, homes and top talent were within the reach of young, unproven companies there was a constant spate of dreamers willing to try it. At today\\u2019s prices, the spate has slowed. Claire Haidar of WNDYR, a productivity startup that relocated to America from Ireland in , reckons it costs at least four times as much to base a startup in the Bay Area as it would in most other cities in America. bably not as new, or as wild, as they would in a startup culture where the pool of other innovators with whom to team up would be larger and more diverse.

For example, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, has raised a $bn technology fund, which is more than the entire American venture-capital industry invested last year.

People complain that such pampering has eroded tech\\u2019s work ethic, with employees focusing on free lunches and other perks.

Some tech firms have experienced delays of up to  months for foreign hires whom they might otherwise have been able to bring over swiftly. Students who come to America for degrees increasingly end up going home afterwards, willingly or not. \\u201cIf you ask me ten years from now why Silicon Valley failed, it will be because we screwed up immigration,\\u201d predicts Randy Komisar of Kleiner Perkins, a venture-capital firm.

At a  Senate hearing, McNary acknowledged that his agents had been overwhelmed by the , calls the INS received annually from local law-enforcement agencies that had detained illegal immigrants and expected that the INS would pick them up. Describing the case of a Salvadoran man the INS declined to remove after arresting him for trespassing, McNary noted that because the man had not been convicted, he was not a priority. The man was then released, and he stole a pickup truck with which he killed two pedestrians.

Just trying to get the official interest rate down would not be enough.\\u00a0 But by  after five more years of depression (similar to the time since the Great Recession now), Keynes became less convinced that \\u2018unconventional monetary policies\\u2019 would work.\\u00a0 In his famous\\u00a0General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes moved on. yment was full and incomes high.\\u00a0 So (macro) economics could appear to provide policies to \\u2018manage\\u2019 capitalism successfully.\\u00a0 But this was just a momentary illusion.\\u00a0 The golden age soon lost its glitter. \\u00a0Keynesian theory and policy was exposed with the first simultaneous international recession of - and was followed by the deep slump of -.\\u00a0 Remember these major collapses in production and investment internationally took place during the supposed operation of Keynesian policies of macroeconomic management, in Pettifor\\u2019s account.  and thus devalue the national currency, and/or inflate financial asset prices.\\u00a0 It is the latter that has mostly happened in the recent period of money printing.\\u00a0 Quantitative easing has not ended the current global depression but merely sparked new financial speculation.

Just trying to get the official interest rate down would not be enough.\\u00a0 But by  after five more years of depression (similar to the time since the Great Recession now), Keynes became less convinced that \\u2018unconventional monetary policies\\u2019 would work.\\u00a0 In his famous\\u00a0General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes moved on.  eveloped a \\u201crevolutionary theory\\u201d of money \\u2013 his Liquidity Preference Theory.\\u00a0 This explained that crises occur when investors or holders of money do not spend it, but hoard it.\\u00a0 They do this for some subjective reasons \\u2013 a lack of \\u2018animal spirits\\u2019, a loss of belief that any spending or investing will deliver sufficient return.\\u00a0 So a surplus of money builds up that is not spent.\\u00a0 The answer, claims Pettifor, is for the monetary authorities to intervene and drive down the cost of borrowing by \\u2018printing\\u2019 money, so that interest rates on borrowing fall below the perceived return on investing.\\u00a0 This will encourage money hoarders to invest.\\u00a0 Such policies are \\u201cstill considered too radical to be acceptable today\\u201d. te of interest\\u2026 since it seems likely that the fluctuations in the market estimation of the marginal efficiency of different types of capital, calculated on the principles I have described above, will be too great to be offset by any practicable changes in the rate of interest\\u201d.\\u00a0 And so Keynes moved on to advocating fiscal spending and state intervention to complement or pump-prime failing business investment.\\u00a0 Pettifor has latched onto that part of Keynesian macro theory and policy, monetary easing, to the neglect of fiscal stimulus, let alone the more radical policy of the \\u2018socialisation of investment\\u2019 (not even mentioned by Pettifor).\\u00a0 Thus Pettifor\\u2019s account of Keynes\\u2019s economics is at his least \\u2018revolutionary\\u2019.  yment was full and incomes high.\\u00a0 So (macro) economics could appear to provide policies to \\u2018manage\\u2019 capitalism successfully.\\u00a0 But this was just a momentary illusion.\\u00a0 The golden age soon lost its glitter. \\u00a0Keynesian theory and policy was exposed with the first simultaneous international recession of - and was followed by the deep slump of -.\\u00a0 Remember these major collapses in production and investment internationally took place during the supposed operation of Keynesian policies of macroeconomic management, in Pettifor\\u2019s account. the study of trends in economies at the aggregate level, escaping the stifling neoclassical obsession with microeconomics (the study of value and markets at the level of the individual unit). \\u00a0She concurs with Keynes\\u2019s theory of money and his explanation of crises under capitalism as being caused by \\u2018hoarding\\u2019 money rather than spending it; and she praises his \\u2018internationalism\\u2019 in arguing for international financial institutions to control financial speculation and avoid instability in market capitalism.\\u00a0 She finishes with the concern that Keynes\\u2019 ideas and policies have been reneged on and rejected and there has been a return to \\u2018decadent\\u2019 capitalism, far removed from the golden age of the post- period when Keynesian policies were applied to make capitalism work effectively for all.\\u00a0 She concludes with the call that \\u201cIt is time to restore the revolutionary Keynes.\\u201d eve that, she relies entirely on the theories and policies of JM Keynes and \\u2018Keynesianism\\u2019.\\u00a0 Recently she published a short article for the prestigious Times Literary Supplement, entitled The indefatigable efforts of J. M. Keynes. This is part of Footnotes to Plato, a TLS Online series appraising the works and legacies of the great thinkers and philosophers.  and thus devalue the national currency, and/or inflate financial asset prices.\\u00a0 It is the latter that has mostly happened in the recent period of money printing.\\u00a0 Quantitative easing has not ended the current global depression but merely sparked new financial speculation. This version of Keynesian economics is thus hardly \\u2018revolutionary\\u2019 or \\u2018radical\\u2019 at all, as it was adopted by all central banks after the Great Recession in  and has failed to restore economic growth, productive investment and average incomes.\",\"o a new career with opportunities for advancement.

Increasingly, the United States is a country divided geographically into have and have-nots. Those who have jobs and high incomes and expensive homes are clustered in some communities, while those who are struggling are concentrated in other communities. Those in the wealthier communities have seen their incomes rise and job prospects soar. Americans in distressed communities have seen jobs evaporate and incomes stagnate.\",\"onal debt, and the fact that we\\u2019ve seen the numbers go up pretty significantly. An increase in  percent to $ billion in deficit for the last fiscal year. I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019re probably hopeful that the tax cuts will pay for themselves long term. But how much do you worry now about that growing deficit and the debt on economic growth and interest rates going forward?   And so, for me, there are two major pillars. One is the economic pillar. The second is the education pillar. And if our goal is to make sure that we spread opportunities and success throughout this nation in an even way, we have to focus first on the education system, particularly the education system in the poorest parts of this country. A poor education system or a failing school typically leads to higher unemployment. Higher unemployment typically leads to more government services. And frankly, obviously, it leads to lower net worth. The correlation, of course, is that education and opportunity are like wet and water. They are very difficult to separate.  ea Jones for POLITICO   do you think we got to this point?  ins in Greenville. And so you could see the development of a support company for the Boeing Corporation here in North Charleston, whether it\\u2019s providing paint for the planes, or rubber for the wheels, or any other aspect of the engineering for the planes, there\\u2019s a ton of opportunities out there that you could see. The second example would be, we are heading towards a service economy in South Carolina. So while we\\u2019re going to continue to celebrate our success as a manufacturing headquarters, we are, at some point in the future, going to become what we call the \\u201cSilicon Harbor\\u201d in Charleston, in the upstate. We\\u2019re going to have a focus on the jobs of the future. And so you could see a company started in the Medical University of South Carolina spill into an opportunity zone. And as that company grows, you would see how quickly investors might find it attractive \\u2026 not only do you have the tax deferral from your initial tax burden, but as your company starts to grow in that zone, that growth is capital gains tax free during those first  years of your growth. m investment in one of these zones, then you can defer\\u2014you don\\u2019t eliminate, but you defer\\u2014your capital gains tax for up to  years, or through the year .

So we\\u2019ve cut taxes, but we always have believed in the Laffer Curve or the inverse relationship.  Unfortunately, at the exact same time, what we\\u2019re seeing is that spending has not leveled off, it\\u2019s not plateaued. It continues to increase. About \\u2014maybe it\\u2019s  percent\\u2014 percent of the budget is on automatic increase because those are our mandatory spending programs.  We are going to have to not look at cutting benefits for our current people. That\\u2019s one of the fictional stories that you can find out there. You can actually reduce our long-term exposure without touching current beneficiaries, or, frankly, people within a -year window of receiving their benefits from an entitlement perspective of Medicare and Social Security. But we do have to wrestle with the long-term consequences of mandatory spending that we haven\\u2019t wrestled with before. But in order for that to happen, we\\u2019re going to have to do that in a bipartisan fashion or it just will not happen.    ave been missed by the economic recovery that we\\u2019ve experienced over the last few years.

And frankly, there\\u2019s typically an uneven success trajectory. There have been communities that have been mired in poverty for generations. And the real question is, how do we break that cycle? One of the ways that you do that is by making sure that the private sector, the free markets, have the ability to operate fully. When that happens, you see the most even spread of our resources. As an example,  years ago, the African American unemployment was about  or  percent. Less than six months ago, it was under  percent. Today, it\\u2019s in the low  percent range. What happens is, as we grow the pie, we see more folks being able to engage in finding and chasing the American dream, which is the fastest way to actually even out the recovery.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested that the program could attract $ billion in investment in distressed areas. s are a prerequisite for success in most of America. I think what you\\u2019re going to see in the next  to  years, and you\\u2019re seeing it start now, is the fact that people can live where they want to and then decide the type of work they want to do. Our economy is absolutely moving in the direction of people deciding the quality of life they want, the location they want. And then later deciding on the job they want because of the ability to work from home. So the truth is that we\\u2019ll probably see more opportunities in rural America than we\\u2019ve ever seen before, as people have the chance to pick and choose their site and then their jobs.

But the ambassador and his office must be clear on the point that trafficking is a serious crime and that failure to prosecute and punish offenders makes a government complicit in the harm.

While many big companies admit that they have to prioritise particular universities because of finite hiring resources they also say that their target list is now more flexible than it might have been in the past and will embrace specific innovative programs on less obvious campuses, particularly in areas such as cyber-security, machine learning and AI. It also means understanding how many employers are making huge efforts to increase workforce diversity, for example by bending over backwards to bring more women into roles based around the all-important STEM subjects. ander Mann Solutions research is that many of the old rules of engagement still remain in place.

For instance, over the past five years, as the pool of unemployed people has shrunk, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities have accounted for a rising share of new hires. Food and beverage service, healthcare and IT have increased hiring of minorities most, while retail, cleaning, and food and beverage service have hired more people with disabilities.   lost if employees leave, employers have incentive to retain staff by raising pay or modifying the workplace in ways that employees value. Some economic models predict that such actions may, under certain circumstances, induce greater effort from employees, which might allow employers to recoup part of the costs in the form of higher productivity.  ers in the UK.

One reason why looking at them might be attractive to employers is that wage growth for people moving from one job to another has accelerated, and that could make hiring people already in work more expensive. rs may find it more costly to hire from these groups due to the extra pay, benefits or training they may require.

Countries with strong quality assurance systems like Australia apply surveys to employers on a systematic basis to capture their views on the quality of training provision. The Employers Use and Views on the Quality of the VET system (see link), carried out bi-annually, measures the degree to which employers perceive they have a choice in selecting public and private training providers to work with, their level of satisfaction with providers, and their overall satisfaction with the skills system. ses miembros.  leads the way in training quality assurance in the Caribbean. d with attribution to the IDB and for any non-commercial purpose.

While these trends are happening more slowly in Latin America and the Caribbean than in developed countries, it is worrying that according to the World Economic Forum\\u2019s Human Capital Index, next to Africa, Latin American and Caribbean countries have the lowest skill levels (see The Future of Work Regional Perspectives). On the one hand, the inadequate supply of skills can prevent countries from attracting new industries that can help them ride the digital wave, creating new jobs, and maybe even developing new competitive niches in the digital economy. On the other, once digital trends reach the region, the inadequate supply of skills could result in displacement of workers as the skills of existing workers become obsolete.  ture of work, public-private partnerships for skills development, and youth employment.

These indicators are submitted on a learner by learner basis to the government based upon which providers receive a scorecard showing their actual and relative position with respect to other providers. Very importantly, all of this data is made publicly available so that learners and employers can make informed choices about education and training (see link). ns are carried out adequately. Quality assurance refers to the mechanisms through which a skills development system can ensure that the objectives or vision established by the system are met, that the quality of inputs including physical teaching infrastructure like schools and labs, teaching materials, teachers, instructors, and leadership is high, and that the results of the training provision in terms of educational outcomes and labor market outcomes are positive. Quality assurance is therefore very much related to a skill development system\\u2019s ability to continuously evaluate itself against a set of quality standards and take measures to improve itself where and when necessary. d juvenil, inserci\\u00f3n laboral y programas de aprendices, principalmente en el Caribe as\\u00ed como en investigaci\\u00f3n relacionada a estos temas.

Training providers are using this industry-approved assessment to benchmark the extent to which their programs are producing quality results that are valued by employers. ically, effective skills development systems perform four main functions (see Amaral et. al): (i) systematically identify present and future skills needs; (ii) translate these skills needs into curricula to be delivered by an ecosystem of training providers; (iii) allocate resources efficiently; and (iv) have mechanisms to ensure that the quality of training provision meets the highest standards. In a world where technological change is rapidly shifting skills demands, it is critical that skills development systems are flexible and dynamic so that they can be truly responsive to changes in the labor market. the answer lies in countries\\u2019 skills development systems and more specifically, in the quality of the education and training provided by these systems.  nas en Honduras en la supervisi\\u00f3n/ejecuci\\u00f3n de proyectos haciendo un periodo en el Banco Mundial como Junior Professional Associate en la preparaci\\u00f3n de la estrategia de pa\\u00eds.
