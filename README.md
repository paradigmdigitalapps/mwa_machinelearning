# mwa_machinelearning
This Python algorithm is used for preparation of text corpus for machine learning.

Please, take a look at this notebook. I combined all the steps together.
The file run_search.py performs the Custom search and creates a .csv file for each search. Before running it you have to edit the API_KEY variable.
Maybe it is a good a idea to schedule the execution of the script, check here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1048358/schedule-python-script
Please, let me know if there is something missing.
