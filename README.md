# mwa_machinelearning
This Python algorithm is used for preparation of text corpus for machine learning.

## This Python algorithm make a step further in the preparation of text corpus for machine learning. Only necessary attributes are used. As a result the original csv file is extended with labels which mark different business categories of the ducuments being listed.

## In another R algoritm I search "workforce mobility" related information on the web and store the new HTML content every day. The R algorithm also cleans the webcontent and takes care that only meaningful content is stored. The result is saved into a csv file and handed over a Python algoritm for furher analysis.

input file for analysis: export_htmlcontent_04162019_en.csv </br>
output file of this Python algorithm: corpus_clusters_en.csv
